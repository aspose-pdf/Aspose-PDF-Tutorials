# Create a PDF with Tables and Pagination
 
Aspose.PDF for .NET is a powerful library that allows developers to create, manipulate, and convert PDF documents programmatically. In this example, we demonstrate how to generate a PDF file, add a table with red borders, populate it with 200 rows, and insert automatic page breaks after every 10 rows. This approach ensures structured content formatting and seamless pagination for large datasets.
