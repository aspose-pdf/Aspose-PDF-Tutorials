## Implementation Guide

### Accessing and Selecting Radio Buttons

#### Overview
Learn how to access radio button groups within your PDF documents and programmatically select options.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Access the RadioButtonField:**
```csharp
// Retrieve the radio button field by its name
RadioButtonField radioButtonField = document.Form["radio"] as RadioButtonField;
```
*Explanation*: Use `document.Form` to access form fields. You'll need the field's name, which can be found using PDF editors like Adobe Acrobat.

**Select a Specific Option:**
```csharp
// Select the third option (index starts at 0)
radioButtonField.Selected = 2;
```
*Explanation*: Radio button options are zero-indexed. Here, selecting index `2` chooses the third option in the group.

#### Saving Changes
After modifications, save your document:
```csharp
// Define output path and save modified PDF
document.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SelectRadioButton_out.pdf");
```

## Practical Applications

Manipulating radio buttons programmatically can enhance productivity in various applications:
- **Automating Survey Updates**: Update responses efficiently.
- **Digital Contract Management**: Automate selections of terms and conditions.
- **E-Learning Forms**: Modify quiz options dynamically.

## Performance Considerations
For optimal performance with large PDFs or numerous fields, consider these tips:
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Dispose of unused objects to free memory.
- **Batch Processing**: Process documents in batches for multiple files.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize async methods for non-blocking operations.
