## Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to add different types of form fields to PDF documents using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

### Add Text Field
#### Overview
Adding a text field allows users to input single-line text data directly within the PDF.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Initialize FormEditor**: Create an instance of `FormEditor`.
    ```csharp
    FormEditor formEditor = new FormEditor();
    ```
2. **Bind the PDF Document**: Open your existing PDF with the `BindPdf` method.
    ```csharp
    string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
    formEditor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/AddFormField.pdf");
    ```
3. **Add a Text Field**: Specify field type, name, and coordinates for placement on the page.
    ```csharp
    formEditor.AddField(FieldType.Text, "textfield", 1, 100, 100, 200, 150);
    ```
4. **Save the Document**: Output the modified PDF to a specified directory.
    ```csharp
    string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
    formEditor.Save(outputDir + "/AddFormField_TextField_out.pdf");
    ```

### Add Checkbox Field
#### Overview
Checkboxes are useful for selections or binary inputs (true/false).

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Bind and Initialize**: Start by binding your PDF document.
    ```csharp
    formEditor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/AddFormField.pdf");
    ```
2. **Add a Checkbox Field**: Use the `AddField` method for checkbox placement.
    ```csharp
    formEditor.AddField(FieldType.CheckBox, "checkboxfield", 1, 100, 200, 200, 250);
    ```
3. **Save Changes**: Save your document with the new field included.
    ```csharp
    formEditor.Save(outputDir + "/AddFormField_CheckBoxField_out.pdf");
    ```

### Add Combo Box Field
#### Overview
Combo boxes provide a dropdown list of options for users to select from.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Initialize and Bind**: Begin with `FormEditor` as before.
    ```csharp
    formEditor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/AddFormField.pdf");
    ```
2. **Create the Combo Box Field**: Define your combo box field details.
    ```csharp
    formEditor.AddField(FieldType.ComboBox, "comboboxfield", 1, 100, 300, 200, 350);
    ```
3. **Save Your Work**:
    ```csharp
    formEditor.Save(outputDir + "/AddFormField_ComboBoxField_out.pdf");
    ```

### Add List Box Field
#### Overview
List boxes allow users to select multiple items from a list.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Bind the PDF**: Use `FormEditor` as usual.
    ```csharp
    formEditor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/AddFormField.pdf");
    ```
2. **Insert a List Box Field**:
    ```csharp
    formEditor.AddField(FieldType.ListBox, "listboxfield", 1, 100, 400, 200, 450);
    ```
3. **Save Document**:
    ```csharp
    formEditor.Save(outputDir + "/AddFormField_ListBoxField_out.pdf");
    ```

### Add Multi-line Text Field
#### Overview
Multi-line text fields are essential for accepting longer inputs.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Bind the PDF**: Initialize and bind your document.
    ```csharp
    formEditor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/AddFormField.pdf");
    ```
2. **Add a Multi-line Field**:
    ```csharp
    formEditor.AddField(FieldType.MultiLineText, "multilinetextfield", 1, 100, 500, 200, 550);
    ```
3. **Finalize Your Document**:
    ```csharp
    formEditor.Save(outputDir + "/AddFormField_MultiLineTextField_out.pdf");
    ```

## Practical Applications

Explore these scenarios where adding form fields is particularly useful:
- **Forms and Surveys**: Embed forms directly in PDFs to enhance user interaction.
