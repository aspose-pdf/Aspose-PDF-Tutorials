        // Load and modify the document as needed
        Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "AddSwfFileAsAnnotation.pdf");
        
        // Specify output path for saving
        string outputPath = dataDir + "AddSwfFileAsAnnotation_out.pdf";
        
        // Save changes to a new file
        doc.Save(outputPath);
