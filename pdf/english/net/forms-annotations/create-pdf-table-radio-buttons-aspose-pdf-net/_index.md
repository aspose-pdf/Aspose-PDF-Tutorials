## Implementation Guide
This section will guide you through creating PDF documents with tables and radio buttons using Aspose.PDF for .NET.
### Create and Add a PDF Document
#### Overview
Creating a new PDF document is straightforward. Start by initializing the `Document` class and adding pages to it.
**Steps:**
1. **Initialize the Document**
   ```csharp
   Document doc = new Document();
   ```
2. **Add Pages**
   ```csharp
   Page page = doc.Pages.Add();
   ```
3. **Save the Document**
   ```csharp
   string outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/CreateAndAddPDF_out.pdf";
   doc.Save(outputPath);
   ```
### Create and Configure a Table in a PDF Page
#### Overview
Tables are essential for organizing data within your PDFs. This section explains how to add tables with specific column widths.
**Steps:**
1. **Create a New Document and Add a Page**
   ```csharp
   Page page = new Document().Pages.Add();
   ```
2. **Initialize the Table**
   ```csharp
   Aspose.Pdf.Table table = new Aspose.Pdf.Table();
   table.ColumnWidths = "120 120 120"; // Define column widths
   ```
3. **Add a Row and Cells to the Table**
   ```csharp
   Row r1 = table.Rows.Add();
   Cell c1 = r1.Cells.Add();
   Cell c2 = r1.Cells.Add();
   Cell c3 = r1.Cells.Add();
   page.Paragraphs.Add(table);
   ```
### Create and Configure a RadioButtonField in PDF
#### Overview
Radio buttons are useful for creating interactive forms. Here, we'll add multiple options to a radio button field.
**Steps:**
1. **Create a New Document and Add a Page**
   ```csharp
   Page page = new Document().Pages.Add();
   ```
2. **Initialize the RadioButtonField**
   ```csharp
   RadioButtonField radioButtonField = new RadioButtonField(page);
   radioButtonField.PartialName = "radio";
   Document doc = new Document();
   doc.Form.Add(radioButtonField, 1);
   ```
3. **Add Radio Button Options**
   ```csharp
   RadioButtonOptionField opt1 = new RadioButtonOptionField() { OptionName = "Item1", Width = 15, Height = 15 };
   RadioButtonOptionField opt2 = new RadioButtonOptionField() { OptionName = "Item2", Width = 15, Height = 15 };
   RadioButtonOptionField opt3 = new RadioButtonOptionField() { OptionName = "Item3", Width = 15, Height = 15 };

   radioButtonField.Add(opt1);
   radioButtonField.Add(opt2);
   radioButtonField.Add(opt3);

   // Configure appearance
   opt1.Border = new Border(opt1) { Width = 1, Style = BorderStyle.Solid };
   opt1.Characteristics.Border = System.Drawing.Color.Black;
   opt1.DefaultAppearance.TextColor = System.Drawing.Color.Red;
   opt1.Caption = new TextFragment("Item1");
   ```
4. **Add Options to Table Cells**
   ```csharp
   c1.Paragraphs.Add(opt1);
   c2.Paragraphs.Add(opt2);
   c3.Paragraphs.Add(opt3);
   ```
