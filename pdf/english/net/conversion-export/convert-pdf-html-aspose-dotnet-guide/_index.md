## Implementation Guide

This section details converting PDF to HTML with stream output capabilities.

### Overview of Conversion Process

The Aspose.PDF library allows you to convert a PDF document into an HTML file while maintaining structure, images, and fonts. Customize the process using various options in `HtmlSaveOptions`.

#### Step 1: Load the PDF Document
First, load your PDF document using the `Document` class:
```csharp
string dataDir = "path_to_your_documents_directory";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Configure HtmlSaveOptions
Configure options to tailor the output HTML. Hereâ€™s how you can set up various parameters:
- **Raster Images Saving Mode**: Determines how images are embedded in the HTML.
  ```csharp
  HtmlSaveOptions newOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions();
  newOptions.RasterImagesSavingMode = HtmlSaveOptions.RasterImagesSavingModes.AsEmbeddedPartsOfPngPageBackground;
  ```
- **Font and Parts Embedding Modes**: Control how fonts are saved and embedded.
  ```csharp
  newOptions.FontSavingMode = HtmlSaveOptions.FontSavingModes.SaveInAllFormats;
  newOptions.PartsEmbeddingMode = HtmlSaveOptions.PartsEmbeddingModes.EmbedAllIntoHtml;
  ```
- **Letters Positioning Method**: Enhances CSS precision for text rendering.
  ```csharp
  newOptions.LettersPositioningMethod = HtmlSaveOptions.LettersPositioningMethods.UseEmUnitsAndCompensationOfRoundingErrorsInCss;
  ```

#### Step 3: Implement Custom Saving Strategy
To handle output using a stream, define a custom saving strategy:
```csharp
newOptions.CustomHtmlSavingStrategy = new HtmlSaveOptions.HtmlPageMarkupSavingStrategy(SavingToStream);
```
Here's the method to save HTML content directly into a stream:
```csharp
private static void SavingToStream(HtmlSaveOptions.HtmlPageMarkupSavingInfo htmlSavingInfo)
{
    byte[] resultHtmlAsBytes = new byte[htmlSavingInfo.ContentStream.Length];
    htmlSavingInfo.ContentStream.Read(resultHtmlAsBytes, 0, resultHtmlAsBytes.Length);
    
    string fileName = "stream_out.html";
    using (Stream outStream = File.OpenWrite(fileName))
    {
        outStream.Write(resultHtmlAsBytes, 0, resultHtmlAsBytes.Length);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Execute Conversion
Finally, execute the conversion by saving the document:
```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "OutPutToStream_out.html", newOptions);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correct and accessible.
- Check that your Aspose.PDF license is properly set to avoid limitations.

## Practical Applications
Converting PDFs to HTML can be beneficial in several scenarios:
1. **Web Portals**: Presenting documents on web platforms where users need dynamic access.
2. **E-commerce**: Showcasing product manuals or brochures directly on product pages.
3. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Integrating PDF content into articles or posts.

## Performance Considerations
Optimizing your conversion process is crucial for performance:
- Use stream output to manage memory usage efficiently.
- Configure `HtmlSaveOptions` to minimize unnecessary data embedding.
- Regularly update Aspose.PDF to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.
