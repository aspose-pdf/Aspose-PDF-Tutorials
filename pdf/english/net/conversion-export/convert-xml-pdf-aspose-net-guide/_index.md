Let's start by ensuring you have the necessary prerequisites.

## Prerequisites (H2)

Before diving into the code, ensure your development environment is properly set up. You’ll need:
1. **Aspose.PDF for .NET** library: Ensure you have at least version 22.x installed.
2. A .NET development environment like Visual Studio or VS Code with .NET Core SDK or .NET Framework installed.
3. Basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with file handling in .NET.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET (H2)

To begin, you'll need to install the Aspose.PDF library in your project. Here's how:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```powershell

```

## Implementation Guide

### XML to PDF Conversion (H2)

Let's explore how you can convert an XML file into a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

#### Overview
This feature enables the transformation of structured XML data into a more universally accessible and distributable format, such as PDF. This is especially useful for generating reports or documents from dynamic data sources.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

**Prepare Your Files (H3):** 
Ensure your source XML file is ready. In this example, we'll use `log.xml`.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Stream src = new FileStream(dataDir + "/log.xml", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
```

**Create Output PDF Stream (H3):**
Set up a stream for the output PDF file.

```csharp
Stream dest = new FileStream(dataDir + "/XMLToPdf_out.pdf", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.ReadWrite);
```

**Convert XML to FDF and Then to PDF (H3):**
Use `FormDataConverter.ConvertXmlToFdf` method which handles the conversion efficiently.

```csharp
// Aspose.Pdf.Facades namespace is required for this operation.
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

FormDataConverter.ConvertXmlToFdf(src, dest);
```

**Close Streams (H4):**
Always ensure to close your streams to free up resources:

```csharp
dest.Close();
src.Close();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure the XML file adheres to the required schema for Aspose.PDF.
- Check for any permission issues in the directory paths.

## Practical Applications (H2)
The ability to convert XML data into PDFs can be invaluable in various scenarios, such as:
1. **Automated Reporting:** Generate dynamic reports from database exports or API responses formatted in XML.
2. **Document Management Systems:** Convert configuration files or logs into shareable PDF formats for easy dissemination.
3. **Educational Content Generation:** Transform structured lesson plans or quizzes into printable materials.

## Performance Considerations (H2)
- Optimize resource usage by managing streams efficiently and disposing of them properly.
- Aspose.PDF is optimized for .NET memory management, but always monitor your application’s performance when handling large files or batch processing.
