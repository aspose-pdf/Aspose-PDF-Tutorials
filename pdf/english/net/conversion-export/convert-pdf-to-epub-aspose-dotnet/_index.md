```
With everything set up, let's proceed to implement PDF to EPUB conversion.

## Implementation Guide

### Convert PDF to EPUB

#### Overview
This feature focuses on converting a PDF file into an EPUB format using specific configurations provided by Aspose.PDF.

##### Step 1: Load the Input PDF Document
Start by loading your PDF document:
```csharp
// Create an instance of the Document class
document = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/PDFToEPUB.pdf");
```
**Explanation**: This initializes a `Document` object, representing the PDF you wish to convert.

##### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
Set up your conversion preferences using `EpubSaveOptions`:
```csharp
// Create an instance of EpubSaveOptions
options = new EpubSaveOptions();

// Set content recognition mode to 'Flow'
options.ContentRecognitionMode = EpubSaveOptions.RecognitionMode.Flow;
```
**Explanation**: The `ContentRecognitionMode.Flow` ensures that the content adapts well across various screen sizes.

##### Step 3: Save the Output EPUB Document
Finally, save your converted document:
```csharp
document.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/PDFToEPUB_out.epub", options);
```
**Explanation**: This step writes the EPUB to a specified directory with all defined settings applied.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Issues**: Ensure correct paths for input and output directories.
- **License Errors**: Verify that your license file is correctly referenced if using a licensed version.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases where converting PDFs to EPUB can be beneficial:
1. **Digital Publishing**: Enhance eBook distribution by offering multiple formats.
2. **Content Accessibility**: Make documents more accessible on e-readers and mobile devices.
