## Implementation Guide

Let's go through the key steps for converting MHT files to PDF.

### Convert MHT to PDF

**Overview:**
This feature allows you to convert an MHT file, which is essentially an HTML archive with embedded resources, into a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   Define the directory paths for your input and output files:
   
   ```csharp
   string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
   string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   ```

2. **Create Load Options**
   Initialize `MhtLoadOptions` to configure any specific loading settings you may need:
   
   ```csharp
   MhtLoadOptions options = new MhtLoadOptions();
   // Example configuration (uncomment if needed):
   // options.PageInfo.IsLandscape = true;
   ```

3. **Load the MHT Document**
   Use `MhtLoadOptions` to load your MHT file into a `Document` object:
   
   ```csharp
   Document document = new Document(dataDir + "/test.mht", options);
   ```

4. **Save as PDF**
   Finally, save the loaded document as a PDF in the desired output directory:
   
   ```csharp
   document.Save(outputDir + "/MHTToPDF_out.pdf");
   ```

### Configure MHT Load Options

**Overview:**
Customizing load options can help optimize how your MHT file is processed before conversion.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Create and Customize `MhtLoadOptions`**
   
   ```csharp
   MhtLoadOptions options = new MhtLoadOptions();
   // Set properties as needed, e.g., page orientation:
   // options.PageInfo.IsLandscape = true;
   ```

### Load a Document from File

**Overview:**
Loading an existing document correctly is crucial for processing and conversion.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Load the MHT File**
   
   ```csharp
   string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
   MhtLoadOptions loadOptions = new MhtLoadOptions();
   Document loadedDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/test.mht", loadOptions);
   ```

### Save a Document to File

**Overview:**
Saving the processed document is the final step in your conversion workflow.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Save as PDF**
   
   ```csharp
   string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   loadedDocument.Save(outputDir + "/output.pdf");
   ```

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases for converting MHT to PDF:

1. **Archiving Web Content:** Convert and archive web pages from projects or research.
