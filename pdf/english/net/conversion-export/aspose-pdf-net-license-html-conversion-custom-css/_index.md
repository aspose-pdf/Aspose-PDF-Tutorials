### Feature 2: PDF to HTML Conversion with Custom CSS Strategies

**Overview:**
This feature allows you to convert PDF documents into HTML format while applying custom strategies for handling CSS, perfect for creating web-ready content from your PDFs.

**Steps:**

#### Step 1: Load Your PDF Document
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Configure HTML Save Options

Use `HtmlSaveOptions` to customize how CSS is handled during the conversion process.

```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions();
saveOptions.CustomStrategyOfCssUrlCreation = new HtmlSaveOptions.CssUrlMakingStrategy(Strategy_10_CSS_ReturnResultPathInPredefinedTestFolder);
saveOptions.CustomCssSavingStrategy = new HtmlSaveOptions.CssSavingStrategy(Strategy_10_CSS_WriteCssToResourceFolder);
```

#### Step 3: Convert PDF to HTML

Perform the conversion using your configured options.

```csharp
string outputHtml = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\ConvertedOutput.html";
pdfDocument.Save(outputHtml, saveOptions);
```

#### Step 4: Implement Custom CSS Strategies

Define helper functions for handling CSS paths and saving strategies:

```csharp
class PrefixToImportDirectivesHelper {
    private static string _folderForReferencedResources = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

    private static void Strategy_10_CSS_WriteCssToResourceFolder(HtmlSaveOptions.CssSavingInfo resourceInfo) {
        string guid = System.Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        string fullPathWithGuid = Strategy_10_CSS_ReturnResultPathInPredefinedTestFolder(new HtmlSaveOptions.CssUrlRequestInfo());
        fullPathWithGuid = string.Format(fullPathWithGuid, guid);

        int prefixLength = fullPathWithGuid.IndexOf(guid);
        int suffixLength = fullPathWithGuid.Length - (fullPathWithGuid.IndexOf(guid) + guid.Length);
        string fullPath = resourceInfo.SupposedURL;
        fullPath = fullPath.Substring(prefixLength);
        string cssFileNameCore = fullPath.Substring(0, fullPath.Length - suffixLength);

        string cssFileName = "style" + cssFileNameCore + ".css";
        string path = _folderForReferencedResources + cssFileName;

        using (BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(resourceInfo.ContentStream)) {
            File.WriteAllBytes(path, reader.ReadBytes((int)resourceInfo.ContentStream.Length));
        }
    }

    private static string Strategy_10_CSS_ReturnResultPathInPredefinedTestFolder(HtmlSaveOptions.CssUrlRequestInfo requestInfo) {
        return "http://localhost:24661/document-viewer/GetResourceForHtmlHandler?documentPath=Deutschland201207Arbeit.pdf&resourcePath=style{0}.css&fileNameOnly=false";
