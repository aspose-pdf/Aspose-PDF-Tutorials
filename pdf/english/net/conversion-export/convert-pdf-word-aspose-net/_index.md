## Implementation Guide

Explore how to convert PDF documents into Word formats using various features of Aspose.PDF.

### Convert PDF to DOC Format
This feature allows you to convert a simple PDF document into Microsoft Word (DOC) format without additional configurations.

#### Overview
Load a PDF file and save it directly as a DOC file, preserving basic formatting.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Load the PDF Document**
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/PDFToDOC.pdf");
```

**Step 2: Save as Word (DOC) Format**
```csharp
pdfDocument.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/PDFToDOC_out.doc", SaveFormat.Doc);
```
This method saves your PDF in DOC format, maintaining the original layout and structure.

### Saving PDF to DOC Using Save Options
Enhance your conversion process with custom save options such as recognition mode or bullet handling.

#### Overview
Specify how the PDF content should be interpreted during conversion.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Load the Source Document**
```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/PDFToDOC.pdf");
```

**Step 2: Configure Save Options**
Create a `DocSaveOptions` object for finer control:
```csharp
DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions();
saveOptions.Mode = DocSaveOptions.RecognitionMode.Flow;
saveOptions.RelativeHorizontalProximity = 2.5f;
saveOptions.RecognizeBullets = true;
```
- **Recognition Mode**: `Flow` mode ensures a natural reading order.
- **Relative Horizontal Proximity**: Adjusts spacing for text elements.
- **Recognize Bullets**: Enables bullet point detection.

**Step 3: Save with Custom Options**
```csharp
pdfDocument.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/saveOptionsOutput_out.doc", saveOptions);
```

Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/PDFToDOC.pdf");
```

**Step 2: Setup DocSaveOptions for DOCX**
Configure the save options to output as DOCX:
```csharp
DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions();
saveOptions.Format = DocSaveOptions.DocFormat.DocX;
```

**Step 3: Save in DOCX Format**
```csharp
pdfDocument.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ConvertToDOCX_out.docx", saveOptions);
```
