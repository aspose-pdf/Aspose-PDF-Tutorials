# How to Retrieve PDF Page Properties Using Aspose.PDF for .NET (Step-by-Step Guide)

## Introduction

Working with PDF documents in a .NET environment often requires retrieving specific page properties such as rotation, page count, and box sizes. These details are essential for tasks like automating report generation or preparing files for print. This guide will show you how to extract these properties efficiently using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to get the rotation of a PDF page.
- Retrieve the total number of pages in a PDF.
- Extract various box sizes (Trim, Art, Bleed, Crop, Media) from PDF pages.
- Implement Aspose.PDF for .NET effectively.

Let's start by setting up your environment!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following are in place:

- **Aspose.PDF for .NET Library**: You'll need version 21.1 or later. This guide uses C# and assumes familiarity with basic programming concepts.
- **Development Environment**: Set up your environment using Visual Studio or another IDE that supports .NET development.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET

### Installation

Add the Aspose.PDF library to your project using one of these methods:

**.NET CLI**
```shell
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**: Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

Start with a free trial by downloading a temporary license from the [Aspose website](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/). For long-term use, consider purchasing a full license. Follow their [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/) for setup instructions.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
PdfPageEditor pageEditor = new PdfPageEditor();
pageEditor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll explore how to use various features of Aspose.PDF for .NET to retrieve specific properties from PDF pages.

### Get Page Rotation

**Overview**: Determine the orientation of a PDF page using rotation values (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees).

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Initialize PdfPageEditor**:
   ```csharp
   PdfPageEditor pageEditor = new PdfPageEditor();
   ```

2. **Bind the PDF Document**:
   ```csharp
   pageEditor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
   ```

3. **Retrieve Page Rotation**:
   ```csharp
   int rotation = pageEditor.GetPageRotation(1);
   Console.WriteLine($"Rotation of Page 1: {rotation} degrees");
   ```
   - `GetPageRotation(int pageNumber)`: Fetches the rotation in degrees for a specified page.

### Get Page Count

**Overview**: Retrieve the total number of pages within your PDF document.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Bind the PDF Document**:
   ```csharp
   pageEditor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
   ```

2. **Get Total Page Count**:
   ```csharp
   int pageCount = pageEditor.GetPages();
   Console.WriteLine($"Total Pages: {pageCount}");
   ```
   - `GetPages()`: Returns the total number of pages in the document.

### Get Page Box Sizes

#### Trim Box Size

**Overview**: Extracts the trim box dimensions for a specific PDF page.

1. **Retrieve Trim Box Size**:
   ```csharp
   SizeF trimBoxSize = pageEditor.GetPageBoxSize(1, "trim");
   Console.WriteLine($"Trim Box Size: {trimBoxSize}");
   ```

#### Art Box Size

1. **Retrieve Art Box Size**:
   ```csharp
   SizeF artBoxSize = pageEditor.GetPageBoxSize(1, "art");
   Console.WriteLine($"Art Box Size: {artBoxSize}");
   ```

#### Bleed Box Size

1. **Retrieve Bleed Box Size**:
   ```csharp
   SizeF bleedBoxSize = pageEditor.GetPageBoxSize(1, "bleed");
   Console.WriteLine($"Bleed Box Size: {bleedBoxSize}");
   ```

#### Crop Box Size

1. **Retrieve Crop Box Size**:
   ```csharp
   SizeF cropBoxSize = pageEditor.GetPageBoxSize(1, "crop");
   Console.WriteLine($"Crop Box Size: {cropBoxSize}");
   ```

#### Media Box Size

1. **Retrieve Media Box Size**:
   ```csharp
   SizeF mediaBoxSize = pageEditor.GetPageBoxSize(1, "media");
   Console.WriteLine($"Media Box Size: {mediaBoxSize}");
   ```
   - `GetPageBoxSize(int pageNumber, string boxType)`: Fetches the dimensions of a specified type of box for a given page.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your document path is correctly set.
- Handle exceptions to avoid runtime errors (e.g., file not found).
- Verify that Aspose.PDF library version compatibility with your project setup.

## Practical Applications

1. **Automated Report Generation**: Adjust page layouts based on content needs by understanding box sizes.
2. **Document Archiving**: Ensure proper orientation and format for archived documents.
3. **Custom Print Layouts**: Use box size information to design tailored print jobs.
4. **PDF Validation Tools**: Validate document integrity using page counts and orientations.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Limit the number of simultaneous PDF operations to prevent memory overload.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Dispose objects when not in use to free up resources promptly.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to harness Aspose.PDF for .NET to retrieve essential page properties from your PDF documents. This capability is invaluable for automating document processing tasks efficiently.
