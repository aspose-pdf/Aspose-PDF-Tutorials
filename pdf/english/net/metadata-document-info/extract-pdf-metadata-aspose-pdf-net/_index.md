## Implementation Guide

### Extracting Document Information

This section will guide you through using Aspose.PDF for .NET to retrieve metadata from a PDF document. We'll focus on accessing key properties like the author, creation date, and more.

#### Initialize Your Project

Create a new C# console application in Visual Studio. Ensure that your project targets .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later (or any compatible .NET version).

#### Set Up Aspose.PDF

Firstly, include the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

#### Load and Retrieve Document Information

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of extracting document information:

**Step 1: Define Your Data Directory**

Determine where your PDF files are stored. Replace `"GetFileInfo.pdf"` with the path to your file.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YourFilePathHere/"; // Modify this line appropriately
```

**Step 2: Open the Document**

Load your document using the Aspose.PDF `Document` class:

```csharp
// Load an existing PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "GetFileInfo.pdf");
```

**Step 3: Access Document Information**

Retrieve and display metadata from the PDF:

```csharp
// Get document information
DocumentInfo docInfo = pdfDocument.Info;

// Display document properties
Console.WriteLine("Author: {0}", docInfo.Author);
Console.WriteLine("Creation Date: {0}", docInfo.CreationDate);
Console.WriteLine("Keywords: {0}", docInfo.Keywords);
Console.WriteLine("Modify Date: {0}", docInfo.ModDate);
Console.WriteLine("Subject: {0}", docInfo.Subject);
Console.WriteLine("Title: {0}", docInfo.Title);
```

This code snippet opens a PDF file, retrieves its metadata, and prints it to the console. It's straightforward yet powerful for accessing essential document properties.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your PDF file path is correct.
- If you encounter licensing issues, double-check that your temporary license is correctly applied.
