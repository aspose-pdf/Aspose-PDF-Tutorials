Document pdfDocument = new Document("path/to/your/file.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide
We will break down the implementation into logical sections for clarity.

### Extracting Page Properties

#### Overview
The primary goal here is to extract various properties from a PDF page, such as dimensions and box measurements. These properties can help you understand the layout and structure of your PDF pages.

##### Step 1: Open the Document
Begin by loading your PDF document into an Aspose.PDF `Document` object.
```csharp
string dataDir = "your/path/to/pdf/";
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "GetProperties.pdf");
```

##### Step 2: Access Page Collection
Retrieve the collection of pages within your document to select specific ones for property extraction.
```csharp
PageCollection pageCollection = pdfDocument.Pages;
Page pdfPage = pageCollection[1]; // Get the second page (index is 0-based)
```

##### Step 3: Retrieve Specific Properties
Extract various properties from your selected page. Each box and dimension provides unique insights into how content is positioned.

```csharp
// ArtBox properties
Console.WriteLine("ArtBox : Height={0}, Width={1}, LLX={2}, LLY={3}, URX={4}, URY={5}", 
    pdfPage.ArtBox.Height, pdfPage.ArtBox.Width, pdfPage.ArtBox.LLX, 
    pdfPage.ArtBox.LLY, pdfPage.ArtBox.URX, pdfPage.ArtBox.URY);

// Repeat for BleedBox, CropBox, MediaBox, TrimBox, Rect
Console.WriteLine("BleedBox : Height={0}, Width={1}, LLX={2}, LLY={3}, URX={4}, URY={5}", 
    pdfPage.BleedBox.Height, pdfPage.BleedBox.Width, pdfPage.BleedBox.LLX, 
    pdfPage.BleedBox.LLY, pdfPage.BleedBox.URX, pdfPage.BleedBox.URY);

// Continue with CropBox, MediaBox, TrimBox, Rect...
Console.WriteLine("Page Number : {0}", pdfPage.Number);
Console.WriteLine("Rotate : {0}", pdfPage.Rotate);
```

#### Explanation
- **ArtBox, BleedBox, etc.**: These boxes define different areas within a PDF page that can be used for various purposes like printing or displaying.
- **LLX, LLY, URX, URY**: Lower-left and upper-right coordinates specifying the box dimensions.

##### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your PDF file path is correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- If properties are not displaying as expected, verify that the page index is accurate (0-based).

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases for retrieving PDF page properties:
1. **Document Layout Analysis**: Use box dimensions to analyze and adjust document layouts programmatically.
2. **PDF Editing Tools**: Integrate these features into tools that modify or annotate PDFs based on specific page metrics.
3. **Pre-Print Validation**: Validate print settings by checking if page content fits within certain boxes like ArtBox or BleedBox.

## Performance Considerations
### Optimizing Performance
- Minimize memory usage by disposing of `Document` objects once you are done with them.
- Use `using` statements to ensure resources are released promptly:
  ```csharp
  using (Document pdfDocument = new Document("path/to/your/file.pdf"))
  {
      // Your code here
  }
  ```

### Resource Usage Guidelines
- Load only necessary pages if you're working with large PDFs to reduce memory footprint.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered how to retrieve various properties from PDF pages using Aspose.PDF for .NET. By understanding and implementing these features, you can enhance your application's document handling capabilities. 

### Next Steps

## FAQ Section
1. **What is the difference between ArtBox and MediaBox?**
   - *ArtBox* defines the area intended for displaying content, while *MediaBox* represents the full physical size of the page including non-printable areas.
2. **Can I extract properties from all pages in a PDF document?**
   - Yes, iterate over `pdfDocument.Pages` to access and retrieve properties from each page individually.
3. **How do I handle encrypted PDFs with Aspose.PDF for .NET?**
   - Use the `Decrypt()` method if you have permission to access the content or use credentials provided by the document's owner.
4. **What are common issues when retrieving PDF properties?**
   - Incorrect file paths, unsupported PDF formats, and missing dependencies can lead to errors. Ensure all prerequisites are met before running your code.
5. **Is there a limit to the number of pages I can process with Aspose.PDF for .NET?**
   - There is no inherent page limit, but performance may vary based on system resources and document complexity.
