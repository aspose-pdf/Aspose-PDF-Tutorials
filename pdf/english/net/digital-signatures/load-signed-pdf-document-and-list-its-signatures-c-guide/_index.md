# Load Signed PDF Document and List Its Signatures in C#

Ever needed to **load signed PDF document** but weren’t sure how to see who actually signed it? You’re not alone—many developers hit that wall when they first touch PDF digital signatures. In this tutorial we’ll load a signed PDF, list the PDF signatures, and explain **how to work with pdf signatures** in a way that feels natural, not forced.

By the end of this guide you’ll be able to:

* Open any signed PDF with Aspose.Pdf for .NET.  
* Retrieve the names of every digital signature inside the file.  
* Understand the difference between *list pdf signatures* and *retrieve pdf digital signatures*.  

No external tools, no vague “see the docs” shortcuts—just a complete, runnable example you can copy‑paste into Visual Studio today.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have the following on your machine:

| Requirement | Why it matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| .NET 6.0 or later (or .NET Framework 4.7+) | Aspose.Pdf supports both, but .NET 6 gives you the newest runtime improvements. |
| **Aspose.Pdf for .NET** NuGet package (latest version) | This library provides the `PdfFileSignature` class we’ll use. |
| A signed PDF file (`signed.pdf`) you can experiment with | Without a real signature the API will return an empty list, which is a useful edge case we’ll cover. |
| Visual Studio 2022 (or any IDE you prefer) | IDE choice isn’t critical, but VS makes debugging easier. |

If you haven’t installed the NuGet package yet, run:

```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Pdf
```

Now that the groundwork is set, let’s start loading that PDF.

## Load Signed PDF Document – Preparing the Environment

The first step is simply to **load signed PDF document** into an `Aspose.Pdf.Document` object. Think of the `Document` class as the PDF’s brain—it knows everything about pages, resources, and, crucially for us, signatures.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // 👉 Step 1: Point to the signed PDF file on disk.
        string pdfPath = @"C:\MyPdfs\signed.pdf";

        // 👉 Step 2: Load the file into Aspose's Document object.
        Document pdfDocument = new Document(pdfPath);

        // The document is now in memory and ready for inspection.
        Console.WriteLine($"Successfully loaded: {pdfPath}");
    }
}
```

**Why we do it this way:**  
* `Document` automatically validates the file structure, so if the PDF is corrupted you’ll get an exception right away—helpful for early error handling.  
* Loading the file once keeps the rest of the workflow fast; we won’t re‑read the disk for each signature query.

> **Pro tip:** Wrap the load in a `try/catch` block if you anticipate missing or malformed files. That way your app can gracefully inform the user instead of crashing.

## List PDF Signatures – Using PdfFileSignature

Now that the PDF is in memory, we can **list pdf signatures**. The `PdfFileSignature` façade gives us a thin wrapper around the low‑level signature objects, exposing a convenient `GetSignatureNames()` method.

```csharp
// Continuing from the previous Main method...

// 👉 Step 3: Create a PdfFileSignature instance linked to our document.
PdfFileSignature pdfSignature = new PdfFileSignature(pdfDocument);

// 👉 Step 4: Pull the signature names.
string[] signatureNames = pdfSignature.GetSignatureNames();

// 👉 Step 5: Show the result.
if (signatureNames.Length == 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("No signatures were found in this document.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Signatures present:");
    Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", signatureNames));
}
```

**What you’ll see:**  
If `signed.pdf` contains two signatures named `JohnDoe` and `AcmeCorp`, the console output will be:

```
Signatures present:
JohnDoe, AcmeCorp
```

If the file has no digital signatures, you’ll get the friendly “No signatures were found” message. This is the **retrieve pdf digital signatures** step that many developers overlook—always check for an empty array before assuming success.

## Retrieve PDF Digital Signatures – Digging Deeper

Sometimes you need more than just the name; perhaps you want the signing date, certificate details, or validation status. Aspose.Pdf lets you fetch the full `SignatureInfo` object for each name.

```csharp
foreach (var name in signatureNames)
{
    // Get detailed info for each signature.
    var info = pdfSignature.GetSignatureInfo(name);

    Console.WriteLine($"--- Signature: {name} ---");
    Console.WriteLine($"Signed on: {info.SignatureDate}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Reason: {info.Reason}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Location: {info.Location}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Is Valid: {info.IsValid}");
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

**Why this matters:**  
* `SignatureDate` tells you when the document was signed—critical for audit trails.  
* `IsValid` runs a quick cryptographic check; if it returns `false`, the signature may have been tampered with.  
* The `Reason` and `Location` fields are optional but often used in enterprise workflows to capture business context.

> **Edge case:** If a signature uses a self‑signed certificate, `IsValid` may be `false` even though the signature is technically intact. In those cases you’ll need to trust the certificate chain manually.

## How to Work with PDF Signatures – Common Pitfalls and Tips

Even with a perfect API, real‑world projects hit snags. Here are a few lessons learned from my own implementations:

| Pitfall | How to avoid it |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Missing permissions** – some PDFs are password‑protected. | Call `pdfDocument.Decrypt("password")` before creating `PdfFileSignature`. |
| **Large documents** – loading a 500 MB PDF can be memory‑intensive. | Use `pdfDocument = new Document(pdfPath, new LoadOptions { MemoryOptimization = true })`. |
| **Multiple signatures with the same name** – rare but possible. | Append an index (`name_1`, `name_2`) when you store them, or use `GetSignatureInfo` to differentiate by timestamp. |
| **Silent failures** – `GetSignatureNames()` returns an empty array without an exception. | Always log the file’s `IsEncrypted` and `IsSigned` properties for diagnostics. |
| **Version incompatibility** – older PDFs (pre‑PDF 1.5) may lack signature dictionaries. | Upgrade the PDF with `pdfDocument.Save("upgraded.pdf")` before checking signatures. |

By keeping these tips in mind, you’ll spend less time hunting bugs and more time building features.

## Full Working Example – One File to Run

Below is the *complete* program you can drop into a new console project. No missing pieces, no hidden dependencies.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

namespace PdfSignatureDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // -------------------------------------------------
            // 1️⃣ Load the signed PDF document
            // -------------------------------------------------
            string pdfPath = @"C:\MyPdfs\signed.pdf";

            Document pdfDocument;
            try
            {
                pdfDocument = new Document(pdfPath);
                Console.WriteLine($"✅ Loaded: {pdfPath}");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"❌ Failed to load PDF: {ex.Message}");
                return;
            }

            // -------------------------------------------------
            // 2️⃣ Create the signature façade
            // -------------------------------------------------
            PdfFileSignature pdfSignature = new PdfFileSignature(pdfDocument);

            // -------------------------------------------------
            // 3️⃣ List PDF signatures (retrieve pdf digital signatures)
            // -------------------------------------------------
            string[] signatureNames = pdfSignature.GetSignatureNames();

            if (signatureNames.Length == 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("🔎 No signatures were found in this document.");
                return;
            }

            Console.WriteLine("🔎 Signatures detected:");
            Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", signatureNames));

            // -------------------------------------------------
            // 4️⃣ Show detailed info for each signature
            // -------------------------------------------------
            foreach (var name in signatureNames)
            {
                var info = pdfSignature.GetSignatureInfo(name);
                Console.WriteLine($"\n--- Signature: {name} ---");
                Console.WriteLine($"Signed on : {info.SignatureDate}");
                Console.WriteLine($"Reason    : {info.Reason}");
                Console.WriteLine($"Location  : {info.Location}");
                Console.WriteLine($"Is Valid  : {info.IsValid}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Expected console output (example):**

```
✅ Loaded: C:\MyPdfs\signed.pdf
🔎 Signatures detected:
JohnDoe, AcmeCorp

--- Signature: JohnDoe ---
Signed on : 2024-11-02 14:35:12
Reason    : Approved
Location  : New York, USA
Is Valid  : True

--- Signature: AcmeCorp ---
Signed on : 2024-11-03 09:12:47
Reason    : Document Review
Location  : London, UK
Is Valid  : True
```

If you run the program against a PDF without signatures, you’ll see the friendly “No signatures were found” line instead.
