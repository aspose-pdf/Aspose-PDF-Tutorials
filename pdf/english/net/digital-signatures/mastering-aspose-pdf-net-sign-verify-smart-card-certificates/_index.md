## Prerequisites (H2)

Before we start implementing our solution, ensure you have the following setup:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies:
- Aspose.PDF for .NET: The core library that enables PDF manipulation.
- .NET Framework or .NET Core/5+/6+: Your development environment must support these versions.

### Environment Setup Requirements:
- A Windows machine to access the certificate store.
- Visual Studio IDE (Community Edition or higher) for development and testing.

### Knowledge Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with working in .NET environments.
  
With your environment ready, let's move on to setting up Aspose.PDF for .NET.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET (H2)

Integrating Aspose.PDF into your project is straightforward. Choose the installation method that suits your workflow:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**: Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps:
- **Free Trial**: Start with a 30-day free trial to explore all features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended evaluation.
- **Purchase**: For long-term use, consider purchasing a subscription. 

To initialize Aspose.PDF in your project:

```csharp
// Initialize Aspose.PDF for .NET
Aspose.Pdf.License license = new Aspose.Pdf.License();
license.SetLicense("Aspose.Total.lic");
```

With the library set up, let's delve into implementing PDF signing and verification.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Sign a PDF with a Smart Card Certificate (H2)

#### Overview:
This feature enables you to sign PDF documents using a certificate from your Windows certificate store, ensuring authenticity and integrity.

##### Step-by-Step Implementation:

**H3: Load the Document**
Start by loading the existing PDF document into an Aspose.Pdf.Document object.
```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "blank.pdf");
```

**H3: Bind the PDF to PdfFileSignature**
Bind your loaded document to a `PdfFileSignature` object for signing operations.
```csharp
using (PdfFileSignature pdfSign = new PdfFileSignature())
{
    pdfSign.BindPdf(doc);
}
```

**H3: Access Windows Certificate Store**
Open the X509 certificate store in read-only mode to select a digital certificate.
```csharp
X509Store store = new X509Store(StoreLocation.CurrentUser);
store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
```

**H4: Select and Configure the Certificate**
Prompt for user input to choose a certificate from the available options.
```csharp
X509Certificate2Collection sel = X509Certificate2UI.SelectFromCollection(
    store.Certificates, null, "Select a certificate:", X509SelectionFlag.SingleSelection);
```

**H3: Sign the Document**
Create an `ExternalSignature` using the selected certificate and sign the document with specified appearance settings.
```csharp
ExternalSignature externalSignature = new ExternalSignature(sel[0]);
pdfSign.SignatureAppearance = dataDir + "demo.png";
pdfSign.Sign(1, "Reason", "Contact", "Location", true,
    new Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 200), externalSignature);
```

**H3: Save the Signed PDF**
Finally, save the signed document to disk.
```csharp
pdfSign.Save(dataDir + "externalSignature2.pdf");
```

##### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure your Smart Card reader is properly installed and configured.
- Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access certificates.

### Feature 2: Verify a Signed PDF (H2)

#### Overview:
This feature lets you verify if a signed PDF document is authentic and has not been tampered with, using signatures in the Windows certificate store.

##### Step-by-Step Implementation:

**H3: Load the Signed Document**
Initialize `PdfFileSignature` with your signed PDF.
```csharp
using (PdfFileSignature pdfSign = new PdfFileSignature(new Document(dataDir + "externalSignature2.pdf")))
{
    // Further verification steps...
}
```

**H4: Retrieve Signature Names**
Fetch all signature names embedded in the document for validation.
```csharp
IList<string> sigNames = pdfSign.GetSignNames();
```

**H3: Verify Each Signature**
Iterate through each signature to check its validity and trustworthiness.
```csharp
for (int index = 0; index < sigNames.Count; index++)
{
    if (!pdfSign.VerifySigned(sigNames[index]) || !pdfSign.VerifySignature(sigNames[index]))
    {
        throw new ApplicationException("Not verified");
    }
}
```

##### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure the certificates used for signing are trusted and not expired.
- Check that you have access to the certificate store.
