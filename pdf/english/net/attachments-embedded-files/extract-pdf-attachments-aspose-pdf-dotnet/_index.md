            // License setup (if you have a license file)
            // var license = new License();
            // license.SetLicense("Aspose.PDF.lic");

            Console.WriteLine("Aspose.PDF for .NET is ready to use!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's explore how to extract attachments from a PDF document.

### Extract Attachments from PDF

#### Overview
This section guides you through extracting embedded files or documents attached within a PDF using Aspose.PDF for .NET. It simplifies handling PDFs containing multiple data types.

##### Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Ensure your project is ready with the necessary references and initialization as discussed in the setup section.

##### Step 2: Open the PDF Document
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

namespace Aspose.Pdf.Examples.CSharp.AsposePDFFacades.Attachments
{
    public class ExtractAllAttachments
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Define the path to your document directory
            string dataDir = "YourDocumentPath/";  // Update with actual path

            // Create an instance of PdfExtractor
            PdfExtractor pdfExtractor = new PdfExtractor();

            // Bind the PDF document you want to work with
            pdfExtractor.BindPdf(dataDir + "ExtractAllAttachments.pdf");
        }
    }
}
```
*Explanation*: The `BindPdf` method links your target PDF file, preparing it for attachment extraction.

##### Step 3: Extract Attachments
```csharp
// Use the ExtractAttachment method to extract all attachments from the bound document
pdfExtractor.ExtractAttachment();
```

##### Step 4: Save Extracted Attachments
```csharp
// Get and save extracted attachments in your desired directory
pdfExtractor.GetAttachment(dataDir);
```
*Explanation*: The `GetAttachment` method saves the extracted files to a specified path.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- **File Not Found**: Ensure file paths are correctly set.
- **Permission Issues**: Run your application with appropriate permissions if accessing restricted directories.

## Practical Applications

Extracting PDF attachments can be beneficial in various scenarios, such as:
1. **Legal Document Management**: Quickly access attached contracts or evidence files for legal reviews.
2. **Educational Resources**: Automate the extraction of supplementary materials from course documents.
3. **Business Reports**: Extract embedded datasets and integrate them with analytics tools.

## Performance Considerations

When working with Aspose.PDF for .NET, consider these tips:
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Dispose of objects no longer needed to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple PDFs in batches to minimize overhead.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage exceptions during extraction.
