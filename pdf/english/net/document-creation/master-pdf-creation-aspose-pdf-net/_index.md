## Implementation Guide

### Document Creation and Saving (Feature 1)

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to create a new PDF document using Aspose.PDF and save it to a specified directory.

**Step 1: Create a New Document**
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;

public class DocumentCreationAndSaving
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        string outFile = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\AddRepeatingColumn_out.pdf";
        
        // Initialize a new PDF document
        Document doc = new Document();
        
        // Save the newly created document
        doc.Save(outFile);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `Document` class is used to instantiate a new PDF. The `Save` method writes this empty document to your specified output directory.

### Page and Table Creation (Feature 2)

#### Overview
Learn how to add pages to your PDF and set up tables within those pages.

**Step 1: Adding a New Page**
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;

public class PageAndTableCreation
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        Document doc = new Document();
        
        // Add a new page to the document
        Aspose.Pdf.Page page = doc.Pages.Add();
        
        // Create an outer table that occupies the full page width
        Aspose.Pdf.Table outerTable = new Aspose.Pdf.Table();
        outerTable.ColumnWidths = "100%";
        outerTable.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left;
        
        // Add the outer table to the page's paragraphs collection
        page.Paragraphs.Add(outerTable);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: Here, we add a new `Page` object to our document and create an `Aspose.Pdf.Table` that spans the entire width of the page. The table is then added to the page’s paragraph list.

### Nested Table with Repeating Columns (Feature 3)

#### Overview
This feature explores creating nested tables within your PDFs, complete with repeating columns for headers.

**Step 1: Create a Nested Table**
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;

public class NestedTableWithRepeatingColumns
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        Document doc = new Document();
        Page page = doc.Pages.Add();
        
        // Instantiate the outer table
        Aspose.Pdf.Table outerTable = new Aspose.Pdf.Table();
        outerTable.ColumnWidths = "100%";
        outerTable.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left;
        
        // Create a nested table object
        Aspose.Pdf.Table mytable = new Aspose.Pdf.Table();
        mytable.Broken = TableBroken.VerticalInSamePage;
        mytable.ColumnAdjustment = ColumnAdjustment.AutoFitToContent;
        
        // Add the outer table to the page's paragraphs collection
        page.Paragraphs.Add(outerTable);
        
        // Create a row and cell in the outer table, then add the nested table
        var bodyRow = outerTable.Rows.Add();
        var bodyCell = bodyRow.Cells.Add();
        bodyCell.Paragraphs.Add(mytable);

        // Set repeating columns for headers
        mytable.RepeatingColumnsCount = 5;
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `Aspose.Pdf.Table` class is used to create both the outer and nested tables. The `RepeatingColumnsCount` property specifies that the first five columns should repeat as headers across pages.

### Adding Header and Data Rows to Table (Feature 4)

#### Overview
We'll add header rows and populate data in our nested table, showcasing how to handle content efficiently.

**Step 1: Add Headers and Data**
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;

public class AddingHeaderAndDataRowToTable
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        Document doc = new Document();
        Page page = doc.Pages.Add();

        // Outer table setup
        Aspose.Pdf.Table outerTable = new Aspose.Pdf.Table();
        outerTable.ColumnWidths = "100%";
        outerTable.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left;

        // Nested table creation
        Aspose.Pdf.Table mytable = new Aspose.Pdf.Table();
        mytable.Broken = TableBroken.VerticalInSamePage;
        mytable.ColumnAdjustment = ColumnAdjustment.AutoFitToContent;

        // Add the outer table to the page's paragraphs collection
        page.Paragraphs.Add(outerTable);

        // Create a row and cell in the outer table, then add the nested table
        var bodyRow = outerTable.Rows.Add();
        var bodyCell = bodyRow.Cells.Add();
        bodyCell.Paragraphs.Add(mytable);
        mytable.RepeatingColumnsCount = 5;

        // Add header row to the nested table
        Aspose.Pdf.Row headerRow = mytable.Rows.Add();
        for (int i = 1; i <= 17; i++)
        {
            headerRow.Cells.Add($"header {i}");
        }

        // Populate data rows in the nested table
        for (int RowCounter = 0; RowCounter <= 5; RowCounter++)
        {
            Aspose.Pdf.Row dataRow = mytable.Rows.Add();
            for (int i = 1; i <= 17; i++)
            {
                dataRow.Cells.Add($"col {RowCounter}, {i}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The nested table’s first row is designated as the header, with subsequent rows populated with sample data. This setup ensures that headers repeat on new pages, maintaining consistent formatting.

## Practical Applications
Aspose.PDF for .NET offers myriad possibilities across various industries:
1. **Financial Reporting**: Generate detailed financial reports using nested tables and repeating columns in PDFs.
2. **Automated Invoice Generation**: Create complex invoices with dynamic data entries and table layouts.
3. **Dynamic Report Creation**: Design and generate custom reports that require programmatically managed content within PDF documents.
