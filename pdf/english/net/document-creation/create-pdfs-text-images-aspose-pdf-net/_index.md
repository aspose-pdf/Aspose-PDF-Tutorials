## Implementation Guide

This section breaks down the process of creating PDFs with text and images using Aspose.PDF for .NET into manageable steps.

### Creating a Document with Text

**Overview:**
Creating a simple PDF document by adding text is straightforward. This feature lets you generate documents programmatically, which can be customized to include specific styling and formatting.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. **Initialize the Document**
   Start by creating an instance of the `Document` class.
   ```csharp
   Document doc = new Document();
   ```
2. **Add a Page**
   Pages are added to the document where you'll place your content.
   ```csharp
   Page page = doc.getPages().add();
   ```
3. **Create and Configure Text Fragment**
   Here, we create a `TextFragment` that contains our desired text, along with specific styling settings like color and size.
   ```csharp
   using Aspose.Pdf;
   using Aspose.Pdf.Text;

   TextFragment t1 = new TextFragment("paragraph 3 segment");
   t1.getTextState().setForegroundColor(Color.RED);
   t1.setTextIsInLineParagraph(true);
   t1.getTextState().setFontSize(12);
   ```
4. **Add the Text to the Page**
   Finally, add the text fragment to the page's paragraphs collection.
   ```csharp
   page.getParagraphs().add(t1);
   doc.save("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/CreateTextPDF_out.pdf");
   ```

### Creating a FloatingBox with Text

**Overview:**
Floating boxes provide an advanced way of organizing content within a PDF, allowing for dynamic layouts.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. **Create the Floating Box**
   Define a `FloatingBox` with specific dimensions.
   ```csharp
   FloatingBox textFloatingBox = new FloatingBox(117, 21);
   ```
2. **Configure Position and Z-index**
   Customize its positioning on the page.
   ```csharp
   textFloatingBox.setZIndex(1);
   textFloatingBox.setLeft(-4);
   textFloatingBox.setTop(-4);
   ```
3. **Add Floating Box to Page**
   Place it within the document's structure.
   ```csharp
   page.getParagraphs().add(textFloatingBox);
   textFloatingBox.getParagraphs().add(t1); // Add previously created text fragment
   doc.save("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/TextFloatingBox_out.pdf");
   ```

### Adding an Image to a FloatingBox

**Overview:**
Incorporating images within floating boxes allows for flexible design and layout options.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. **Initialize the Image**
   Prepare your image object with the file path.
   ```csharp
   using Aspose.Pdf;

   Image image = new Image();
   image.setFile("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/test_image.png");
   ```
2. **Create and Configure a Floating Box for the Image**
   Similar to text, define a floating box but tailored for an image.
   ```csharp
   FloatingBox imageFloatingBox = new FloatingBox(117, 21);
   page.getParagraphs().add(imageFloatingBox);

   imageFloatingBox.setLeft(-4);
   imageFloatingBox.setTop(-4);
   imageFloatingBox.setZIndex(2);
   ```
3. **Add the Image to the Floating Box**
   Place your image within the floating box and save it.
   ```csharp
   imageFloatingBox.getParagraphs().add(image);
   doc.save("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/ImageInFloatingBox_out.pdf");
   ```
