## Implementation Guide

Now, let's break down how to use Aspose.PDF for .NET to add images and text to PDFs. We'll cover each feature in detail.

### Adding an Image to a PDF
#### Overview
Adding an image to a specific location within your PDF can enhance its visual appeal or provide additional information. This section will guide you through the process of embedding an image using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Prepare Your Environment**: Ensure you have paths set up for your input file, output file, and image.
2. **Open File Streams**: Use `FileStream` to read the image and create an output PDF stream.
   ```csharp
   using (FileStream inImgStream = new FileStream("image.jpg", FileMode.Open))
   {
       using (FileStream outputStream = new FileStream("output.pdf", FileMode.Create))
       ```
3. **Load the Document**: Initialize your PDF document with `Document`.
   ```csharp
doc = new Document("input.pdf");
```
4. **Create PdfFileMend Instance**: Use this to modify the document.
   ```csharp
   PdfFileMend mendor = new PdfFileMend(doc);
```
5. **Add the Image**: Specify the page number and coordinates for image placement.
   ```csharp
   mendor.AddImage(inImgStream, 1, 50, 50, 100, 100);
```
6. **Save Changes**: Close the `PdfFileMend` instance to save your modifications.
   ```csharp
   mendor.Close();
```
#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correct and accessible.
- Check for valid coordinates that fit within the page dimensions.

### Adding Text to a PDF
#### Overview
Inserting formatted text into a PDF can highlight information or add annotations. This section will walk you through adding text with specific attributes using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Prepare File Paths**: Define paths for your input and output files.
2. **Open Output Stream**: Create an output stream for the PDF.
   ```csharp
   using (FileStream outputStream = new FileStream("output.pdf", FileMode.Create))
```
3. **Load Document**: Initialize with `Document`.
   ```csharp
doc = new Document("input.pdf");
```
4. **Create PdfFileMend Instance**: To modify the document.
   ```csharp
   PdfFileMend mendor = new PdfFileMend(doc);
```
5. **Define Formatted Text**: Specify text attributes like color, font style, and size.
   ```csharp
   FormattedText ft = new FormattedText(
       "Sample text",
       Color.FromArgb(0, 200, 0),
       FontStyle.TimesRoman,
       EncodingType.Winansi,
       false,
       12);
```
6. **Add Text**: Set the page number and coordinates.
   ```csharp
   mendor.AddText(ft, 1, 50, 100, 100, 200);
```
7. **Save Changes**: Close `PdfFileMend` to apply changes.
   ```csharp
   mendor.Close();
```
#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Validate text encoding and font settings.
- Ensure coordinates are within the page dimensions.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where adding images or text to PDFs can be beneficial:
1. **Invoice Customization**: Insert logos or additional notes directly into invoices for branding purposes.
2. **Report Generation**: Add charts and annotations to reports to enhance data visualization.
