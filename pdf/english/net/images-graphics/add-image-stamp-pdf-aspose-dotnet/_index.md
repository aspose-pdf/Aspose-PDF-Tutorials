# How to Add an Image Stamp to a PDF Document Using Aspose.PDF for .NET

## Introduction

Enhance your PDF documents by adding professional image stamps like logos or watermarks with Aspose.PDF for .NET. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of implementing an image stamp feature, allowing you to customize PDFs efficiently and effectively.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to add image stamps as background or foreground elements in a PDF.
- Techniques for controlling image quality within your stamps.
- The process of incorporating image stamps into floating boxes for complex layouts.

Before we begin, ensure that your development environment is set up correctly with the necessary libraries and dependencies.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you'll need:
- **.NET Development Environment:** Ensure you have .NET Core or .NET Framework installed.
- **Aspose.PDF for .NET Library:** This library provides functionality to manipulate PDF files easily.
- **Basic Knowledge of C#:** Familiarity with object-oriented programming in C# will be helpful.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET

To get started, install the Aspose.PDF for .NET package using one of the following methods:

### Using .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

### Using Package Manager Console
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

### Using NuGet Package Manager UI
1. Open your project in Visual Studio.
2. Navigate to **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.
3. Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

#### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial:** Download a temporary license from [Aspose's website](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) to explore all features without limitations.
- **Purchase:** For ongoing use, consider purchasing a license through [Aspose's purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization
Start by initializing your project with Aspose.PDF:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

// Initialize the Document object
document = new Document();
```

## Implementation Guide
This section is divided into three main features: adding an image stamp, controlling its quality, and using it within a floating box.

### Add Image Stamp to PDF
**Overview:** This feature demonstrates how to add an image stamp to your PDF document. You can position the stamp anywhere on the page, control its size, rotation, and opacity.

#### Step 1: Open Your Document
```csharp
document = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/" + "AddImageStamp.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Create an Image Stamp
```csharp
ImageStamp imageStamp = new ImageStamp("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/" + "aspose-logo.jpg");
imageStamp.Background = true; // Set the stamp as background
imageStamp.XIndent = 100; // Horizontal position
imageStamp.YIndent = 100; // Vertical position
imageStamp.Height = 300; // Height of the image stamp
imageStamp.Width = 300; // Width of the image stamp
imageStamp.Rotate = Rotation.on270; // Rotate the stamp by 270 degrees
imageStamp.Opacity = 0.5; // Set opacity to make it semi-transparent
```

#### Step 3: Add Stamp to a Page
```csharp
document.Pages[1].AddStamp(imageStamp);
```

#### Step 4: Save Output Document
```csharp
document.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/" + "AddImageStamp_out.pdf");
```

### Control Image Quality
**Overview:** Adjust the quality of your image stamp to balance between file size and visual clarity.

#### Set Image Quality
```csharp
imageStamp.Quality = 10; // Lower value means lower quality
document.Pages[1].AddStamp(imageStamp);
document.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/" + "ControlImageQuality_out.pdf");
```

### Add Image Stamp as Background in Floating Box
**Overview:** Enhance your PDF by placing an image stamp within a floating box, allowing for more intricate document designs.

#### Create a Document and Page
```csharp
document = new Document();
Page page = document.Pages.Add();
```

#### Set Up the FloatingBox
```csharp
FloatingBox aBox = new FloatingBox(200, 100);
aBox.Left = 40;
aBox.Top = 80;
aBox.HorizontalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.HorizontalAlignment.Center;

// Add text and set border
aBox.Paragraphs.Add(new TextFragment("main text"));
aBox.Border = new BorderInfo(BorderSide.All, Aspose.Pdf.Color.Red);

// Background image for the FloatingBox
aBox.BackgroundImage = new Image { File = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/" + "aspose-logo.jpg" };
aBox.BackgroundColor = Aspose.Pdf.Color.Yellow;

// Add to page
page.Paragraphs.Add(aBox);
```

#### Save the Document
```csharp
document.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/" + "AddImageStampAsBackgroundInFloatingBox_out.pdf");
```

## Practical Applications
1. **Branding:** Use image stamps for branding purposes, adding company logos on each page.
2. **Watermarking:** Protect sensitive documents by applying watermarks using the stamp feature.
3. **Document Templates:** Create templates with pre-defined stamps for consistent document formatting.

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize resource usage by adjusting image quality and dimensions appropriately.
- Manage memory efficiently when handling large PDF files, ensuring that unnecessary objects are disposed of promptly.
