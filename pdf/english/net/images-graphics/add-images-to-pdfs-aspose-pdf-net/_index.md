## Implementation Guide

### Add Image to an Existing PDF

This feature allows you to add images to specific locations within existing PDF documents.

#### Overview

Learn how to position and insert images into a PDF, ideal for adding logos or custom graphics to your documents.

#### Steps to Implement

##### Step 1: Load the PDF Document

Start by opening an existing PDF file using Aspose.PDF’s `Document` class.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Pdf;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/AddImage.pdf");
```

##### Step 2: Set Image Coordinates

Determine where you want the image to appear on your PDF page by setting coordinates.

```csharp
int lowerLeftX = 100;
int lowerLeftY = 100;
int upperRightX = 200;
int upperRightY = 200;

Page page = pdfDocument.Pages[1];
```

##### Step 3: Load the Image into a Stream

Load your image file into a stream to allow Aspose.PDF to access and manipulate it.

```csharp
FileStream imageStream = new FileStream(dataDir + "/aspose-logo.jpg", FileMode.Open);
page.Resources.Images.Add(imageStream);
```

##### Step 4: Position and Draw the Image

Use operators like `GSave`, `ConcatenateMatrix`, and `Do` to place and render the image.

```csharp
page.Contents.Add(new GSave());

Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(lowerLeftX, lowerLeftY, upperRightX, upperRightY);
Matrix matrix = new Matrix(new double[] { rectangle.URX - rectangle.LLX, 0, 0, rectangle.URY - rectangle.LLY, rectangle.LLX, rectangle.LLY });

page.Contents.Add(new ConcatenateMatrix(matrix));
XImage ximage = page.Resources.Images[page.Resources.Images.Count];
page.Contents.Add(new Do(ximage.Name));

page.Contents.Add(new GRestore());
```

##### Step 5: Save the Updated Document

Finally, save your document with the newly added image.

```csharp
string outputDir = dataDir + "/AddImage_out.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(outputDir);
```

### Add DICOM Image to a New PDF

This feature demonstrates creating a new PDF from a DICOM file, commonly used in medical imaging.

#### Overview

Learn how to convert and include DICOM images into newly created PDFs, enhancing your document processing capabilities.

#### Steps to Implement

##### Step 1: Create a New Document

Initialize a new `Document` object to serve as your PDF container.

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
using System.IO;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

using (Document pdfDocument = new Document())
{
    pdfDocument.Pages.Add();
```

##### Step 2: Configure the DICOM Image

Set up an `Aspose.Pdf.Image` object to handle the DICOM file.

```csharp
    Aspose.Pdf.Image image = new Aspose.Pdf.Image();
    image.FileType = ImageFileType.Dicom;
    image.ImageStream = new FileStream(dataDir + "/0002.dcm", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
```

##### Step 3: Add the Image to the PDF

Insert the image into your document’s page.

```csharp
    pdfDocument.Pages[1].Paragraphs.Add(image);

    string dicomOutputDir = dataDir + "/PdfWithDicomImage_out.pdf";
    pdfDocument.Save(dicomOutputDir);
}
```

## Practical Applications

Aspose.PDF for .NET enables various practical applications:
1. **Automated Report Generation**: Seamlessly add branding images to company reports.
2. **Medical Document Processing**: Convert DICOM files into accessible PDFs for easier sharing and storage.
3. **Marketing Materials**: Integrate product images into brochures and catalogs efficiently.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when working with Aspose.PDF:
- Use streams wisely to manage memory usage effectively.
- Dispose of file streams properly after use to prevent resource leaks.
- Leverage multi-threading for processing large batches of PDFs concurrently, if applicable.

## Conclusion
