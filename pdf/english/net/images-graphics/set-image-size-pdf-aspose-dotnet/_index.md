### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of C# programming and PDF manipulation concepts will be beneficial.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET
To begin, install the Aspose.PDF library:

**Using .NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Package Manager Console in Visual Studio**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
Open your project in Visual Studio, navigate to NuGet Package Manager, search for "Aspose.PDF," and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
Aspose offers different licensing options:
- **Free Trial**: Test full functionality.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for evaluation purposes.

To initialize Aspose.PDF, create an instance of the `Document` class to represent your PDF file.
```csharp
// Basic Initialization
using Aspose.Pdf;

Document doc = new Document();
```

## Implementation Guide
Now let's implement setting image size in a PDF document.

### Adding and Configuring an Image
#### Step 1: Add a Page to the PDF Document
Add a page where you'll place the image.
```csharp
// Add a new page
Aspose.Pdf.Page page = doc.Pages.Add();
```
#### Step 2: Create and Configure the Image
Instantiate an `Image` object, set its dimensions in points, specify the file type, and define the source image path.
```csharp
// Create an instance of the Image class
Aspose.Pdf.Image img = new Aspose.Pdf.Image();

// Set the width and height of the image (in points)
img.FixWidth = 100;
img.FixHeight = 100;

// Define the image file type
img.FileType = ImageFileType.Unknown; // Adjust as necessary

// Specify the path to your source image
dataDir += "aspose-logo.jpg";
img.File = dataDir;
```
#### Step 3: Add Image to Page and Save Document
Add the configured image to the page's paragraphs collection and save your PDF.
```csharp
// Add the image to the page
page.Paragraphs.Add(img);

// Set page properties if necessary
canvas.PageInfo.Width = 800;
canvas.PageInfo.Height = 800;

// Define output path for the resultant PDF
string dataDir = "SetImageSize_out.pdf";

// Save the document
doc.Save(dataDir);
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correct and accessible.
- Verify Aspose.PDF is correctly installed and referenced in your project.

## Practical Applications
Setting image sizes within PDFs has numerous applications:
1. **Digital Marketing**: Customize brochures with specific logo dimensions for branding consistency.
2. **Academic Papers**: Adjust figures to fit formatting guidelines of journals or conferences.
3. **Business Reports**: Ensure charts and graphs are sized appropriately for clarity in financial presentations.

## Performance Considerations
When working with Aspose.PDF, consider these tips:
- Optimize image files before embedding them to reduce file size and improve load times.
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of unused objects promptly.

Following best practices ensures your application runs smoothly without unnecessary resource consumption.
