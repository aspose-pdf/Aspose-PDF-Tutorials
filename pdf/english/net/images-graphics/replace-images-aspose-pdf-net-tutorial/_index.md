## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll walk through the steps required to replace an image within a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

### Feature Overview: Replace Image in PDF
This functionality allows you to modify images on specific pages of a PDF. Whether it's updating logos or replacing outdated graphics, this feature is essential for maintaining current and professional documents.

#### Step 1: Open the Input PDF
To begin, create an instance of `PdfContentEditor` and bind your target PDF document:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

// Initialize PdfContentEditor object
PdfContentEditor pdfContentEditor = new PdfContentEditor();

// Define your directory paths
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
pdfContentEditor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/ReplaceImage.pdf");
```
#### Step 2: Replace the Image
Next, use the `ReplaceImage` method. Specify the page number and image index (starting from 1) along with the path to your new image file:
```csharp
// Replace image on a specific page
pdfContentEditor.ReplaceImage(1, 1, dataDir + "/aspose-logo.jpg");
```
**Parameters Explained:**
- `pageNumber`: The PDF page where the image resides.
- `imageIndex`: Index of the image you intend to replace (zero-based).
- `newImagePath`: Path to the new image file.

#### Step 3: Save the Output PDF
Finally, save the modified document to your desired output directory:
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
pdfContentEditor.Save(outputDir + "/ReplaceImage_out.pdf");
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Issues**: Ensure all file paths are correct and accessible.
- **Index Errors**: Verify that the image index corresponds to an existing image on the specified page.
