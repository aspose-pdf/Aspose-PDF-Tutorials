- Adding an image stamp with `PdfFileStamp` and `Stamp`
- Configuring stamp properties: position, rotation, background placement
- Selecting specific pages for stamping
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **Aspose.PDF for .NET**: The core library for PDF manipulation.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment like Visual Studio supporting .NET projects.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
Familiarity with C# and object-oriented programming concepts is beneficial.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET
To use Aspose.PDF, follow these installation steps:

### Installation Instructions
**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Using Package Manager in Visual Studio:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

**Via NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Open your project in Visual Studio.

2. **Temporary License**: Apply for an extended testing period without limitations.
3. **Purchase**: For production use, consider purchasing a license.

### Basic Initialization
Set up your project as follows:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

// Initialize PDF operations
PdfFileStamp fileStamp = new PdfFileStamp();
```
With the library installed and initialized, let's add an image stamp.

## Implementation Guide
### Adding an Image Stamp to Specific Pages
This feature allows for selective branding or watermarking across your document. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Open Your PDF Document
Create a `PdfFileStamp` instance and bind it to the desired PDF file.
```csharp
// Define the directory path for documents
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/";

// Create an instance of PdfFileStamp
PdfFileStamp fileStamp = new PdfFileStamp();

// Open the document you want to stamp
fileStamp.BindPdf(dataDir + "AddImageStamp-Page.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize and Configure Your Stamp
Create a `Stamp` object, set its properties like position, rotation, and background.
```csharp
// Initialize a new Stamp object
Stamp stamp = new Stamp();

// Bind an image file to the stamp
stamp.BindImage(dataDir + "aspose-logo.jpg");

// Define the origin (x, y) coordinates for the stamp placement
stamp.SetOrigin(200, 200);

// Rotate the stamp by 90 degrees
stamp.Rotation = 90.0F;

// Set the stamp to appear in the background of the page
stamp.Background = true;
```

#### Step 3: Specify Pages and Apply the Stamp
Choose which pages should receive the stamp.
```csharp
// Define specific pages (e.g., page 1) for the stamp
stamp.Pages = new int[] { 1 };

// Add the configured stamp to the PDF file
fileStamp.AddStamp(stamp);
```

#### Step 4: Save and Close
Save your document and close the `PdfFileStamp` object.
```csharp
// Save the updated document
fileStamp.Save(dataDir + "AddImageStamp-Page_out.pdf");

// Release resources by closing the PdfFileStamp object
fileStamp.Close();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
If you encounter issues:
- Ensure paths to your PDF and image files are correct.
- Verify that Aspose.PDF is correctly referenced in your project.

## Practical Applications
Adding image stamps can serve various purposes:
1. **Branding**: Add company logos for consistency.
2. **Watermarking**: Secure documents as confidential.
3. **Customization**: Personalize PDFs with unique images.
4. **Document Tracking**: Embed tracking codes in strategic areas.
5. **Integration**: Use this feature alongside data processing systems.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance:
- Limit the number of stamps added simultaneously to avoid memory overload.
- Process large PDFs in chunks if possible.
- Manage resources by disposing of objects promptly after use.

Adopting best practices for .NET memory management will ensure smooth operation and prevent leaks or slowdowns.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to add an image stamp selectively using Aspose.PDF for .NET. By following these steps, you can enhance your PDF documents with tailored visual elements. Explore further by experimenting with different configurations and integrating this functionality into larger systems.
