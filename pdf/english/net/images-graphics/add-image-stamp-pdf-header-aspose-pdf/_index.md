## Implementation Guide

### Adding an Image Stamp to PDF Headers

Add a custom image stamp to each page's header in your PDF document for branding or additional information.

#### Step 1: Open Existing PDF Document
Load your existing PDF into the Aspose.Pdf.Document object:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Pdf;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual directory path

// Load an existing PDF document
document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/ImageinHeader.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Create and Configure ImageStamp Object
Set up the `ImageStamp` object by specifying the image file, margins, and alignment:
```csharp
// Create an ImageStamp with your desired image
ImageStamp imageStamp = new ImageStamp(dataDir + "/aspose-logo.jpg");
imageStamp.TopMargin = 10;
imageStamp.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center;
imageStamp.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top;
```

#### Step 3: Iterate and Add Stamp to Each Page
Apply the image stamp to each page's header:
```csharp
// Apply the image stamp to each page's header
document.ForEach(page => page.AddStamp(imageStamp));
```

#### Step 4: Save the Updated PDF Document
Define the output file path, ensuring the directory exists before saving:
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your output directory path

// Ensure the output directory exists
if (!Directory.Exists(outputDir))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDir);
}

currentOutputPath = Path.Combine(outputDir, "ImageinHeader_out.pdf");
document.Save(currentOutputPath); // Save the modified PDF
```

### Managing File Output Paths
Properly managing file paths ensures files are saved correctly without errors.

#### Step 1: Define Input and Output Paths
```csharp
string dataDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Placeholder directory path
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Placeholder output directory path

currentInputPath = Path.Combine(dataDirectory, "ImageinHeader.pdf");
currentOutputPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "ImageinHeader_out.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Ensure Directory Existence
Always check if the target directory exists to avoid runtime errors.
```csharp
if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
}
```

## Practical Applications

Real-world scenarios for adding image stamps include:
1. **Branding**: Insert your company logo into every document.
2. **Watermarking**: Protect documents with a watermark on each page's header.
3. **Document Tracking**: Add date and batch numbers for internal tracking.

## Performance Considerations
For large PDFs, optimize performance by:
- Reducing image stamp resolution to decrease processing time.
- Using .NET memory management best practices by disposing of objects when no longer needed.
- Processing documents in batches if handling multiple files simultaneously.

## Conclusion

You've learned how to add custom image stamps to your PDF headers using Aspose.PDF for .NET. From setting up the library to implementing and managing file paths, you're ready to start enhancing your PDFs with professional touches. Consider exploring more features like merging or encrypting PDFs next.
