# Create Accessible Tagged PDFs Using Aspose.PDF for .NET: Enhance Titles, Alt Text, and Layout

## Introduction
Creating accessible documents is crucial in today's digital age. One common challenge developers face is ensuring that their PDF files are tagged correctly to support screen readers and other assistive technologies. This tutorial focuses on enhancing your PDFs using the powerful Aspose.PDF for .NET library. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, you'll learn how to set titles, alternative text for images, and bounding box attributes in tagged PDF documents.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set a title and alternative text for images in a tagged PDF
- Setting layout attributes like BBox for figure elements
- Moving span elements into paragraphs within table cells

Let's dive into the prerequisites before we get started!

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

- **Libraries & Dependencies:** Ensure you have Aspose.PDF for .NET installed. You can use any version compatible with your project.
- **Environment Setup:** This guide assumes you are using a .NET development environment such as Visual Studio or VS Code.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Familiarity with C# and basic PDF handling concepts will be helpful.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET

### License Acquisition
You can start with a free trial to explore features. For extended use, consider obtaining a temporary license or purchasing one through [Aspose's purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization
```csharp
// Initialize Aspose.PDF Document object
Document document = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/TH.pdf");
```
With the basics set up, let’s move on to implementing specific features.

## Implementation Guide
We’ll break down each feature into clear steps. Follow these guides to enhance your PDFs effectively.

### Set Title and Alternative Text for Tagged PDF
**Overview:**
This feature allows you to set a title for your entire document and provide alternative text descriptions for images, making them accessible to screen readers.

#### Step 1: Import Required Namespaces
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.LogicalStructure;
using Aspose.Pdf.Tagged;
```

#### Step 2: Open the PDF Document
```csharp
Document document = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/TH.pdf");
ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.TaggedContent;
StructureElement rootElement = taggedContent.RootElement;
```

#### Step 3: Set the Title for the Tagged PDF
```csharp
taggedContent.SetTitle("Document with images");
```
**Explanation:**  
The `SetTitle` method assigns a title to your entire document, improving its accessibility.

#### Step 4: Assign Alternative Text to Images
```csharp
foreach (FigureElement figureElement in rootElement.FindElements<FigureElement>(true)) {
    figureElement.AlternativeText = "Figure alternative text (technique 2)";
}
```
**Explanation:**  
The `AlternativeText` property provides a description for each image, essential for visually impaired users.

#### Step 5: Save the Document
```csharp
document.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/TH_out.pdf");
```
### Set BBox Attribute for Figure Elements in Tagged PDF
**Overview:**
This feature sets layout attributes like bounding boxes (BBox) for figure elements, defining their spatial properties within a page.

#### Step 1: Import Required Classes
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.LogicalStructure;
using Aspose.Pdf.Tagged;
```

#### Step 2: Open the PDF Document
```csharp
Document document = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/TH.pdf");
ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.TaggedContent;
StructureElement rootElement = taggedContent.RootElement;
```

#### Step 3: Create and Set BBox Attribute
```csharp
foreach (FigureElement figureElement in rootElement.FindElements<FigureElement>(true)) {
    StructureAttribute bboxAttribute = new StructureAttribute(AttributeKey.BBox);
    bboxAttribute.SetRectangleValue(new Rectangle(0.0, 0.0, 100.0, 100.0));

    StructureAttributes figureLayoutAttributes = figureElement.Attributes.GetAttributes(AttributeOwnerStandard.Layout);
    figureLayoutAttributes.SetAttribute(bboxAttribute);
}
```
**Explanation:**  
The `SetRectangleValue` method defines the position and size of your figures within the page layout.

#### Step 4: Save the Updated Document
```csharp
document.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/TH_out_boundingbox.pdf");
```
### Move Span Element into Paragraph in Tagged PDF
**Overview:**
This feature demonstrates how to move a span element into a paragraph, enhancing document structure and accessibility.

#### Step 1: Import Required Namespaces
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.LogicalStructure;
using Aspose.Pdf.Tagged;
```

#### Step 2: Open the PDF Document
```csharp
Document document = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/TH.pdf");
ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.TaggedContent;
StructureElement rootElement = taggedContent.RootElement;
```

#### Step 3: Find and Move Elements
```csharp
TableElement tableElement = rootElement.FindElements<TableElement>(true)[0];
SpanElement spanElement = tableElement.FindElements<SpanElement>(true)[0];
TableTDElement firstTdElement = tableElement.FindElements<TableTDElement>(true)[0];
ParagraphElement paragraph = firstTdElement.FindElements<ParagraphElement>(true)[0];

spanElement.ChangeParentElement(paragraph);
```
**Explanation:**  
Changing the parent element of a span to a paragraph ensures better semantic structure.

#### Step 4: Save Changes
```csharp
document.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/TH_out_movedspan.pdf");
```
## Practical Applications
Enhancing tagged PDFs has numerous real-world applications:
1. **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensures documents meet accessibility standards for screen readers.
2. **Improved SEO:** Better structured documents can improve search engine indexing.
3. **User Experience:** Provides a seamless experience for users with disabilities.

Integration possibilities include creating accessible reports, legal documents, or educational materials.
