# Compare two PDFs in C# – Complete Side‑by‑Side Guide

Ever needed to **compare two PDFs** and weren’t sure where to start in C#? You’re not alone—many developers hit this exact wall when version‑controlling contracts or checking generated reports. The good news? With a few lines of Aspose.Pdf code you can load pdf document c# and run a side by side pdf comparison in seconds.

In this tutorial we’ll walk through everything you need to know: from installing the library, loading the PDFs, configuring comparison options, to saving and verifying the result. By the end you’ll have a ready‑to‑run snippet that **compares two PDFs** side‑by‑side, and you’ll understand why each setting matters.

## Compare Two PDFs – Setting Up the Project

Before we dive into code, let’s make sure the environment is ready.

### Prerequisites
- **.NET 6.0** or later (the example uses .NET 6, but any recent .NET version works).
- **Aspose.Pdf for .NET** NuGet package. Install it via the Package Manager Console:

```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Pdf
```

- A folder that contains two PDF files you want to compare, e.g., `ComparingSpecificPages1.pdf` and `ComparingSpecificPages2.pdf`.

> **Pro tip:** Keep your PDFs in a sub‑folder called `Data` to avoid path headaches later.

## Load PDF Document C# – Initializing Aspose.Pdf

Now that the project is ready, the first logical step is to **load pdf document c#**. This step is crucial because the comparer works on `Document` objects, not raw file streams.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Comparison;

class PdfComparisonDemo
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Step 1: Define the folder that contains the PDF files
        string dataDir = @"./Data/";

        // Step 2: Load the two PDF documents you want to compare
        using (var firstDoc = new Document(dataDir + "ComparingSpecificPages1.pdf"))
        using (var secondDoc = new Document(dataDir + "ComparingSpecificPages2.pdf"))
        {
            // The rest of the logic goes here...
        }
    }
}
```

**Why this matters:**  
- `using` ensures the file handles are released promptly, preventing file‑locking issues on Windows.  
- By keeping the `dataDir` variable separate, you can reuse the same path for other PDF‑related tasks, which is handy when you later **load pdf document c#** for additional processing.

## Configure Side‑by‑Side PDF Comparison Options

Aspose.Pdf offers a flexible `SideBySideComparisonOptions` class. You can tweak it to ignore whitespace, highlight changes, or even set a custom output resolution. For most scenarios, the defaults work fine, but let’s enable a couple of useful flags.

```csharp
// Step 3: Configure side‑by‑side comparison options
var comparisonOptions = new SideBySideComparisonOptions
{
    // Show where text was added, removed, or modified
    AdditionalChangeMarks = true,
    // Ignore insignificant whitespace differences
    ComparisonMode = ComparisonMode.IgnoreSpaces
};
```

**Explanation:**  
- `AdditionalChangeMarks = true` draws red/green markers on the pages, making it obvious *what* changed.  
- `ComparisonMode = ComparisonMode.IgnoreSpaces` prevents false positives caused by formatting tweaks—essential when you **compare two PDFs** that were generated by different tools but contain the same logical content.

## Execute the Comparison and Save the Result

With the documents loaded and options set, the actual **side by side pdf comparison** is a single method call. We’ll compare the first page of each document, but you can loop over all pages if needed.

```csharp
// Step 4: Compare page 1 of each document and save the result
SideBySidePdfComparer.Compare(
    firstDoc.Pages[1],                 // Page index is 1‑based
    secondDoc.Pages[1],
    dataDir + "ComparingSpecificPages_out.pdf",
    comparisonOptions);
```

After the call finishes, the output file `ComparingSpecificPages_out.pdf` will contain both original pages placed side by side, with change marks highlighted.

### Expected Output

Open the generated PDF and you should see something like this:

![Result of compare two PDFs side‑by‑side](/images/pdf-comparison.png){alt="Result of compare two PDFs side‑by‑side"}

- The left pane shows **ComparingSpecificPages1.pdf**.  
- The right pane shows **ComparingSpecificPages2.pdf**.  
- Red highlights indicate deletions, green highlights indicate insertions.

If the two source pages are identical, the output will be a clean side‑by‑side view with no markers.

## Verify the Output and Common Pitfalls

Even the best‑written code can surprise you when the input PDFs have quirks. Here are a few things to double‑check:

| Issue | Symptom | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **Different page sizes** | Mis‑aligned side‑by‑side view | Set `comparisonOptions.PageSize = new Size(595, 842);` to force a common size. |
| **Encrypted PDFs** | `PdfException: Document is encrypted` | Supply the password via `firstDoc.Decrypt("pwd");` before comparison. |
| **Large documents** | Long processing time | Compare only the pages you need, or run the comparison in a background thread. |

### Frequently Asked Questions

- **Can I compare more than one page at a time?**  
  Absolutely. Loop over `firstDoc.Pages` and call `SideBySidePdfComparer.Compare` for each pair, or use the batch overload that accepts entire `Document` objects.

- **Do I need a license for Aspose.Pdf?**  
  The library works in evaluation mode, but the output will contain a watermark. For production use, obtain a license to remove it.

- **Is the comparison case‑sensitive?**  
  By default, text comparison is case‑sensitive. If you want a case‑insensitive check, set `comparisonOptions.ComparisonMode = ComparisonMode.IgnoreCase`.

## Wrap‑Up: What You’ve Learned

You now have a complete, runnable example that **compare two PDFs** in C# using a side by side pdf comparison approach. The tutorial covered:

1. Installing Aspose.Pdf and setting up the project.  
2. How to **load pdf document c#** safely with `using` blocks.  
3. Configuring `SideBySideComparisonOptions` for meaningful change detection.  
4. Executing the comparison and saving a visual side‑by‑side result.  
5. Verifying the output and handling common edge cases.

### Next Steps

- Try looping over *all* pages to generate a full‑document side‑by‑side report.  
- Explore the `PdfComparer` class for a *text‑only* diff without visual layout.  
- Combine the comparison with a CI pipeline so every generated contract gets automatically validated.
