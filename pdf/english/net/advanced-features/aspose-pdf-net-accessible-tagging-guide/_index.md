```

## Implementation Guide

Explore the features and learn how to implement them in your .NET applications using Aspose.PDF.

### Setting Title and Language for a PDF Document

**Overview**: Setting the title and language is crucial for accessibility as it helps screen readers understand the document context better.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Document
Create an instance of `Document`.
```csharp
document = new Document();
```

#### Step 2: Access Tagged Content
Retrieve the `ITaggedContent` interface from your document object.
```csharp
ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.TaggedContent;
```

#### Step 3: Set Title and Language
Specify the title and language to enhance accessibility.
```csharp
taggedContent.SetTitle("Tagged Pdf Document");
taggedContent.SetLanguage("en-US");
```

### Creating Logical Structure Elements in a Tagged PDF Document

**Overview**: Logical structure elements like sections organize your content semantically, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret.

#### Step 1: Create a Section Element
Generate a section element and add it to the root.
```csharp
SectElement sect = taggedContent.CreateSectElement();
taggedContent.RootElement.AppendChild(sect);
```

### Creating Paragraph Elements with Custom Tags

**Overview**: Assigning custom tags to paragraphs helps define their semantic roles within your document.

#### Step 1: Create and Tag Paragraphs
Create paragraph elements, set their text, and apply specific tags.
```csharp
ParagraphElement p1 = taggedContent.CreateParagraphElement();
p1.SetText("P1. ");
p1.SetTag("P1");
```

### Appending Paragraph Elements to a Section Element

**Overview**: Organize your document by appending paragraphs to sections.

#### Step 1: Append Paragraphs to Section
Add previously created paragraph elements to the section element.
```csharp
sect.AppendChild(p1);
```

### Creating and Appending Span Elements within Paragraph Elements

**Overview**: Spans can be used for styling or semantic purposes within paragraphs.

#### Step 1: Create and Tag Spans
Generate span elements, set their text, and append them to paragraphs.
```csharp
SpanElement span1 = taggedContent.CreateSpanElement();
span1.SetText("Span 1.");
p1.AppendChild(span1);
```

### Saving a Tagged PDF Document

**Overview**: Once your document is fully structured and tagged, save it with custom configurations.

#### Step 1: Save the Document
Define an output directory and save your document.
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
document.Save(outputDirectory + "CustomTag.pdf");
```
