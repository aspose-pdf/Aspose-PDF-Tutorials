With Aspose.PDF set up, let’s proceed to adding headers.

## Implementation Guide

### Adding Headers with Text Stamps

The core functionality of this guide is to add different headers using text stamps. Let's break down the process step-by-step.

#### Step 1: Open Source Document
First, open your source PDF document where you want to apply headers:

```csharp
string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_StampsWatermarks();
Aspose.Pdf.Document doc = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "AddingDifferentHeaders.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Create Text Stamps for Headers
Create text stamps representing each header. Customize their appearance with font styles, colors, and alignments:

```csharp
// Create three different headers
Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp stamp1 = new Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp("Header 1");
stamp1.VerticalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.VerticalAlignment.Top;
stamp1.HorizontalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.HorizontalAlignment.Center;
stamp1.TextState.FontStyle = FontStyles.Bold;
stamp1.TextState.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
stamp1.TextState.FontSize = 14;

Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp stamp2 = new Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp("Header 2");
stamp2.VerticalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.VerticalAlignment.Top;
stamp2.HorizontalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.HorizontalAlignment.Center;
stamp2.Zoom = 10;

Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp stamp3 = new Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp("Header 3");
stamp3.VerticalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.VerticalAlignment.Top;
stamp3.HorizontalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.HorizontalAlignment.Center;
stamp3.RotateAngle = 35;
stamp3.TextState.BackgroundColor = Color.Pink;
stamp3.TextState.Font = FontRepository.FindFont("Verdana");
```

#### Step 3: Add Stamps to Specific Pages
Add each stamp to a specific page within the document:

```csharp
// Adding stamps to individual pages
doc.Pages[1].AddStamp(stamp1);
doc.Pages[2].AddStamp(stamp2);
doc.Pages[3].AddStamp(stamp3);
```

#### Step 4: Save Updated Document
Finally, save your PDF with headers applied:

```csharp
string outputDir = dataDir + "multiheader_out.pdf";
doc.Save(outputDir);
Console.WriteLine("\nDifferent headers added successfully.\nFile saved at " + outputDir);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure the source document path is correct to avoid file not found errors.
- If stamps do not appear as expected, verify alignment and zoom settings.

## Practical Applications
Adding different headers can be beneficial in various scenarios:
1. **Multi-section Reports**: Differentiating sections with unique headers aids readability.
2. **Branding Documents**: Apply company logos or specific branding styles to each section of a document.
3. **Legal Documents**: Use headers for legal disclaimers on specific pages.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using Aspose.PDF:
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of objects that are no longer needed to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing**: If processing large batches, consider breaking them into smaller chunks to manage memory usage efficiently.
