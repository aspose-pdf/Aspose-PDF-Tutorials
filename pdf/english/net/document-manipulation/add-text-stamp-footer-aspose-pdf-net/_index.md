### Adding Text Stamp Footer

#### Overview

This feature allows you to automatically place custom text at the bottom of each page in your PDF document. It’s perfect for adding copyright notices or branding elements consistently throughout your files.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Open Your PDF Document**
   
   Load the PDF file from your specified directory.
   
   ```csharp
   string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/TextinFooter.pdf";
   Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir);
   ```

2. **Create a TextStamp Object**
   
   Initialize the `TextStamp` with your desired footer text.
   
   ```csharp
   TextStamp textStamp = new TextStamp("Footer Text");
   ```

3. **Configure Stamp Properties**
   
   Set margins and alignment to position it as a footer on each page.
   
   ```csharp
   textStamp.BottomMargin = 10;
   textStamp.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center;
   textStamp.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Bottom;
   ```

4. **Add the Text Stamp to All Pages**
   
   Iterate through the document’s pages and apply the stamp.
   
   ```csharp
   foreach (Page page in pdfDocument.Pages)
   {
       page.AddStamp(textStamp);
   }
   ```

5. **Save the Updated Document**
   
   Specify an output path and save the modified PDF.
   
   ```csharp
   string outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/TextinFooter_out.pdf";
   pdfDocument.Save(outputPath);
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure file paths are correctly specified to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Check alignment properties if the footer appears misplaced.

## Practical Applications

Adding footers can serve various purposes:

1. **Branding**: Consistently display your company logo or name across all documents.
2. **Legal Notices**: Include copyright information or disclaimers automatically.
3. **Document Tracking**: Add page numbers or version details as footnotes for easy reference.

Integrating this feature with other systems can enhance document automation workflows, particularly in legal and financial sectors.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large PDFs:
- Optimize resource usage by processing documents in batches if possible.
- Monitor memory consumption to prevent leaks, especially when handling multiple files simultaneously.

Following best practices for .NET memory management ensures your application remains efficient and responsive.
