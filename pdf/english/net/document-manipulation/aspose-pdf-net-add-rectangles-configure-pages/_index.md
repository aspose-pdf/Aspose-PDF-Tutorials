# Add Rectangles & Configure Pages with Aspose.PDF .NET

## Mastering PDF Manipulation: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Introduction

Creating and customizing PDF documents is essential in many software applications, from generating reports to crafting marketing materials. With Aspose.PDF for .NET, developers can easily add shapes like rectangles and configure page setups such as size and margins. This guide will walk you through creating a blank PDF document, adding colored rectangles with specific positions and z-order values using C#. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to apply these features effectively in your projects.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up an Aspose.PDF for .NET project
- Creating and configuring a PDF document's pages
- Adding colored rectangles with specific z-order values to a PDF page

Let's start by discussing the prerequisites needed before implementing these functionalities.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, ensure you have:

- **.NET Development Environment**: A working setup of .NET (preferably .NET 5 or later) on your system.
- **Aspose.PDF for .NET Library**: Install the Aspose.PDF library via NuGet package manager using the methods below.
- **Basic C# Knowledge**: Familiarity with C# programming is recommended to understand and implement the code snippets effectively.

### Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET

#### Installation Instructions:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Using Package Manager in Visual Studio:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

**Via NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Open your project in Visual Studio.
- Navigate to "Manage NuGet Packages."
- Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

#### License Acquisition:

Start with a **free trial license** from [Aspose's download page](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/) or request a **temporary license** for extended testing. For commercial projects, consider purchasing a full license via their [purchase site](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

#### Basic Initialization:

Reference the Aspose.PDF library at the beginning of your C# file:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

## Implementation Guide

### Document Creation and Page Setup

Creating a PDF document with specific page configurations is straightforward using Aspose.PDF. Here’s how you can create a blank PDF and set up the page dimensions and margins.

#### Step 1: Create a New PDF Document

Start by instantiating a `Document` object, which represents your PDF document:
```csharp
// Instantiate Document class object
Document doc = new Document();
```

#### Step 2: Add a Page to the Document

Add a new page to your document’s pages collection. This is where you will be adding content later.
```csharp
// Add a page to the document's pages collection
Page page = doc.Pages.Add();
```

#### Step 3: Configure Page Size and Margins

Set the dimensions of the PDF page using `SetPageSize` method, and configure the margins if needed. Here, we set all margins to zero:
```csharp
// Set size of the PDF page (width, height)
page.SetPageSize(375, 300);

// Set margins for the page to zero on all sides
topMargin = 0;
```

#### Step 4: Save the Document

Finally, save your document using `Save` method:
```csharp
string outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ControlRectangleZOrder_out.pdf";
doc.Save(outputFilePath);
```

### Adding Rectangles to PDF Page

Next, let's add colored rectangles with specific positions and z-order values to a PDF page.

#### Step 1: Create and Configure the Document

Recreate your document setup as shown previously. This serves as our base for adding shapes:
```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
Page page = doc.Pages.Add();

page.SetPageSize(375, 300);
topMargin = 0;
```

#### Step 2: Define the AddRectangle Method

Create a method to add rectangles with specific attributes:
```csharp
private void AddRectangle(Page page, float x, float y, float width, float height, Color color, int zIndex)
{
    // Create a graph object for drawing shapes
    Graph graph = new Graph(width * 1.0f, height * 1.0f);
    
    // Set the position of the graph (rectangle's top-left corner)
    graph.Left = x;
    graph.Top = y;

    // Create and configure a rectangle shape
    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(0, 0, width, height);
    rect.GraphInfo.FillColor = color;
    rect.GraphInfo.Color = color;

    // Add the rectangle to the shapes collection of the graph object
    graph.Shapes.Add(rect);
    
    // Set Z-Index for layering order among multiple shapes
    graph.ZIndex = zIndex;
    
    // Add the graph (with rectangle) to the page's paragraphs collection
    page.Paragraphs.Add(graph);
}
```

#### Step 3: Add Rectangles with Different Properties

Utilize the `AddRectangle` method to add rectangles of varying colors and z-order values:
```csharp
// Add rectangles with different positions, sizes, colors, and Z-Index
AddRectangle(page, 50, 40, 60, 40, Color.Red, 2);
AddRectangle(page, 20, 20, 30, 30, Color.Blue, 1);
AddRectangle(page, 40, 40, 60, 30, Color.Green, 0);

// Save the document with rectangles
doc.Save(outputFilePath);
```

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases where these PDF manipulation techniques can be applied:
- **Invoices and Receipts**: Customize layouts for financial documents by adding specific logos or branding elements as colored shapes.
- **Marketing Materials**: Design promotional brochures with layered graphical elements to highlight key messages.
- **Technical Drawings**: Create detailed schematics with annotations, where the z-order helps in visual layering of different components.

## Performance Considerations

When working with PDFs using Aspose.PDF for .NET, consider these performance tips:
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Dispose of large objects and free up resources when they are no longer needed.
- **Batch Processing**: If handling multiple documents, process them in batches to manage memory efficiently.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you have learned how to set up a PDF document with Aspose.PDF for .NET and add custom rectangles with defined positions and z-order. These skills can be extended further by exploring additional features provided by the library.

### Next Steps:
- Explore other shapes and graphical elements you can add to your PDFs.
- Experiment with different page setups to create diverse document layouts.

## FAQ Section

1. **How do I change the color of a rectangle?**
   - Modify the `FillColor` property of the `Rectangle` object to any desired color using `Color.Red`, `Color.Blue`, etc.

2. **What does Z-Index control in Aspose.PDF?**
   - The z-index determines the layering order of shapes on a PDF page, with higher values appearing above lower ones.

3. **Can I add text along with rectangles to my PDF?**
   - Yes, use `TextFragment` or `TextBuilder` classes to place and customize text in your document.

4. **Is it possible to save the PDF as different formats using Aspose.PDF?**
   - Absolutely, Aspose.PDF supports conversion to formats like HTML, images (JPEG/PNG), and more.

5. **How do I handle large-scale PDF processing with Aspose.PDF?**
   - Utilize batch processing techniques and manage resources carefully to avoid memory overflow issues.
