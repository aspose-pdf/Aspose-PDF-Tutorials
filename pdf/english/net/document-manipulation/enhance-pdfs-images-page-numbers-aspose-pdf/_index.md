## Implementation Guide

### Adding an Image to the PDF Header

#### Overview
Adding an image to your PDF header can make documents look more engaging and professional. This section will walk you through how to achieve this with Aspose.PDF for .NET.

**Step 1: Initialize Document Object**
Create a new `Document` object which represents the entire PDF file:
```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Document doc = new Aspose.Pdf.Document();
```

**Step 2: Create Page and Header Section**
Add a page to your document and create a header section for it:
```csharp
// Add a page
Aspose.Pdf.Page page = doc.Pages.Add();

// Initialize the header section
Aspose.Pdf.HeaderFooter header = new Aspose.Pdf.HeaderFooter();
page.Header = header;
```

**Step 3: Insert Image into Header**
Create an image object, set its file path, and add it to the header:
```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Image image1 = new Aspose.Pdf.Image();
image1.File = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "aspose-logo.jpg");
header.Paragraphs.Add(image1);
```

**Step 4: Save Document**
Finally, save your document with the header image included:
```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "HeaderWithImage_out.pdf");
doc.Save(outputFilePath);
```

### Adding Page Numbers to the PDF Footer

#### Overview
Including page numbers in your PDF footer is crucial for documents that span multiple pages. This guide explains how to do it with Aspose.PDF for .NET.

**Step 1: Initialize Document and Add a Page**
Start by creating a new `Document` object:
```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Document doc = new Aspose.Pdf.Document();
// Add a page
Aspose.Pdf.Page page = doc.Pages.Add();
```

**Step 2: Create Footer Section**
Create a footer section for your document:
```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.HeaderFooter footer = new Aspose.Pdf.HeaderFooter();
page.Footer = footer;
```

**Step 3: Add Page Number to Footer**
Insert a text fragment that dynamically shows the page number:
```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextFragment txt = new Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextFragment("Page: ($p of $P)");
footer.Paragraphs.Add(txt);
```

**Step 4: Save Document with Footer**
Save your document to include the footer with page numbers:
```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "FooterWithPageNumber_out.pdf");
doc.Save(outputFilePath);
```

## Practical Applications

Enhancing PDFs with headers and footers is not just about aesthetics; it serves practical purposes too. Here are some use cases:

1. **Corporate Reports:** Adding company logos to headers can reinforce brand identity.
