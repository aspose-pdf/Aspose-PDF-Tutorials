## Implementation Guide
Let's explore key features of Aspose.PDF for .NET, divided into logical sections.

### Creating and Modifying PDF Documents
#### Overview
Creating and modifying PDFs is essential for dynamic document generation. With Aspose.PDF, you can easily add text, images, and even interactive elements to your documents.

**Step 1: Adding Text**
```csharp
// Create a page object
var page = document.Pages.Add();

// Add text fragment
textFragment = new TextFragment("Hello, World!");
page.Paragraphs.Add(textFragment);
```
- **Parameters:** `TextFragment` accepts text and formatting options.
- **Purpose:** To insert readable content into your PDF.

**Step 2: Adding Images**
```csharp
// Load an image from file
var image = new Aspose.Pdf.Image();
image.File = "path/to/image.jpg";

// Add the image to a page
page.Paragraphs.Add(image);
```
- **Parameters:** `Image` class allows specifying image paths and dimensions.
- **Purpose:** To enrich documents with visual content.

### Merging PDF Files
#### Overview
Combining multiple PDF files into one document is often necessary for reports or consolidated documentation.

**Step 1: Load Existing Documents**
```csharp
// Initialize new document to merge into
var mergedDocument = new Aspose.Pdf.Document();

// Open existing documents
doc1 = new Aspose.Pdf.Document("file1.pdf");
doc2 = new Aspose.Pdf.Document("file2.pdf");

// Add pages from each document
mergedDocument.Pages.Add(doc1.Pages);
mergedDocument.Pages.Add(doc2.Pages);
```
- **Purpose:** To create a single cohesive PDF file.

### Extracting Data
#### Overview
Extract text or images from existing PDFs for data processing or analysis.

**Step 1: Text Extraction**
```csharp
// Open the document
class DocumentTextExtractor
{
    public void ExtractText(string filePath)
    {
        var pdfDocument = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(filePath);

        // Iterate through each page and extract text
        foreach (Page page in pdfDocument.Pages)
        {
            var textAbsorber = new TextAbsorber();
            page.Accept(textAbsorber);
            Console.WriteLine(textAbsorber.Text);
        }
    }
}
```
- **Purpose:** To retrieve textual data for further processing.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all necessary files are accessible and paths correctly specified.
- Check API documentation if encountering method-specific errors.
