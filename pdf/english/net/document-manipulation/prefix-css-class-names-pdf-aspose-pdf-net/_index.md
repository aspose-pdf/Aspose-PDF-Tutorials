# How to Prefix CSS Class Names in PDFs Using Aspose.PDF for .NET

## Introduction

Converting a PDF document into an HTML format while maintaining consistent styling across multiple files can be challenging, especially when ensuring that converted HTML pages have unique and non-conflicting CSS class names. **Aspose.PDF for .NET** provides a streamlined solution to prefix CSS class names during conversion.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use Aspose.PDF for .NET to convert PDF documents to HTML with custom prefixes for CSS class names. You'll learn how to set up your environment, implement the necessary code, and apply these techniques in practical scenarios.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up Aspose.PDF for .NET
- Converting PDFs to HTML with prefixed CSS class names
- Understanding key configuration options
- Applying this method in real-world applications

Let's begin by reviewing the prerequisites before diving into the implementation details.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies:
- **Aspose.PDF for .NET** (version 21.1 or later)

### Environment Setup Requirements:
- A development environment with .NET Framework or .NET Core installed
- Access to a code editor like Visual Studio

### Knowledge Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of C# programming
- Familiarity with PDF and HTML document structures

With these prerequisites in place, let’s proceed to set up Aspose.PDF for your project.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET

To begin working with Aspose.PDF, you need to install the library. Here are several methods to add it to your project:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:** 
Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore basic features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license if you need full access temporarily.
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a license for long-term projects.

After installation, initialize Aspose.PDF in your project by creating a `Document` instance as shown:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

// Initialize the Document object
Document pdfDocument = new Document("input.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that we've set up our environment, let’s implement prefixing CSS class names during PDF to HTML conversion.

### Initializing and Configuring Save Options

Start by creating an instance of `HtmlSaveOptions` where you can specify your custom prefixes for CSS classes:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
using System.IO;

namespace Aspose.Pdf.Examples.CSharp.AsposePDF.DocumentConversion.PDFToHTMLFormat
{
    public class PrefixCSSClassNames
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            try
            {
                string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_DocumentConversion_PDFToHTMLFormat();
                
                Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
                string outHtmlFile = dataDir + "PrefixCSSClassNames_out.html";
                
                HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions
                {
                    CssClassNamesPrefix = ".gDV__ .stl_"
                };
                
                pdfDocument.Save(outHtmlFile, saveOptions);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Key Steps Explained
- **CssClassNamesPrefix**: This parameter allows you to set a custom prefix for CSS class names. By setting it to `".gDV__ .stl_"`, all CSS classes in the converted HTML will start with this prefix, helping avoid naming conflicts.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your input PDF path is correct.
- Check for typos in namespace and method names.
- Verify Aspose.PDF version compatibility.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases where prefixing CSS class names can be beneficial:

1. **Web Content Management Systems**: When converting multiple PDF documents to HTML, prefixed CSS classes ensure unique styling across different pages.
2. **Educational Platforms**: Schools and e-learning platforms can convert academic materials into web-friendly formats without style conflicts.
3. **Document Archiving**: Organizations can archive historical documents in a web format while maintaining consistent styling.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large PDF files, consider the following tips to optimize performance:
- **Batch Processing**: Convert multiple PDFs in batches rather than individually to reduce overhead.
- **Resource Management**: Dispose of `Document` objects after use to free up memory.
- **Efficient Coding Practices**: Use asynchronous methods where applicable to improve responsiveness.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you’ve learned how to implement CSS class name prefixing during the PDF-to-HTML conversion using Aspose.PDF for .NET. This approach helps maintain unique styling and avoids conflicts in web environments.

**Next Steps:**
- Experiment with different `HtmlSaveOptions` configurations.
- Explore additional features of Aspose.PDF for more complex document conversions.
