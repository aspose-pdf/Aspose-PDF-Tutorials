```

## Implementation Guide

Now let's dive into each feature. We'll provide detailed steps for implementation and highlight key considerations.

### Feature 1: Concatenate PDF Files

**Overview:** This section demonstrates how you can merge two PDF files into one using Aspose.PDF .NET.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

##### Step 1: Initialize PdfFileEditor
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

PdfFileEditor pdfEditor = new PdfFileEditor();
```

##### Step 2: Concatenate Files
```csharp
pdfEditor.Concatenate(
    new FileStream(dataDir + "/input1.pdf", FileMode.Open),
    new FileStream(dataDir + "/input2.pdf", FileMode.Open),
    new FileStream(dataDir + "/ConcatenatePdfFiles_out.pdf", FileMode.Create)
);
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- `FileStream` objects for the source PDFs and destination output.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure file paths are correct.
- Check for sufficient permissions to read/write files.

### Feature 2: Insert Blank Page

**Overview:** Adding a blank page at specific locations in your PDF can be useful for placeholders or formatting.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

##### Step 1: Load the Document
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

Document pdfDocument = new Document(new FileStream(dataDir + "/Concatenated_Table_Of_Contents.pdf", FileMode.Open));
```

##### Step 2: Insert Blank Page
```csharp
pdfDocument.Pages.Insert(1);
```

### Feature 3: Add Text Stamps

**Overview:** This feature allows you to add text stamps, such as headers or footers, at specified locations.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

##### Step 1: Create and Configure the Stamp
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Text;

Stamp stamp = new Stamp();
stamp.BindLogo(new FormattedText(
    "Table Of Contents", Color.Maroon, Color.Transparent,
    FontStyle.Helvetica, EncodingType.Winansi, true, 18));
```

##### Step 2: Set Position and Apply
```csharp
PdfFileInfo pdfFileInfo = new PdfFileInfo(new FileStream(dataDir + "/input1.pdf", FileMode.Open));
stamp.SetOrigin((pdfFileInfo.GetPageWidth(1) / 3), 700);
stamp.Pages = new int[] { 1 };
```

### Feature 4: Create Local Links

**Overview:** Adding local links in a PDF can enhance navigation within the document.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

##### Step 1: Initialize PdfContentEditor
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;
using System.Drawing;

PdfContentEditor contentEditor = new PdfContentEditor();
contentEditor.BindPdf(new FileStream(dataDir + "/Concatenated_Table_Of_Contents.pdf", FileMode.Open));
```

##### Step 2: Create the Link
```csharp
contentEditor.CreateLocalLink(
    new Rectangle(150, 650, 100, 20), 2, 1, Color.Transparent);
```
