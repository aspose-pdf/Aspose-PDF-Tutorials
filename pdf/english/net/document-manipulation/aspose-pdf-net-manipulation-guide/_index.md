### PDF Creation and Manipulation

#### Creating a New Document
Creating PDFs from scratch is straightforward:

**Initialize Document:**
```csharp
// Create a new document object
document = new Document();
```
**Explanation:** This initializes an empty PDF document.

#### Adding Text and Images
Adding content to your PDF is simple with Aspose.PDF.

**Add Text to the Page:**
```csharp
Page page = document.Pages.Add();
TextFragment textFragment = new TextFragment("Hello, World!");
page.Paragraphs.Add(textFragment);
```
**Explanation:** This snippet adds a "Hello, World!" text fragment to the newly created page.

#### Adding Images

**Embed an Image:**
```csharp
Image image = new Image();
image.File = "path/to/your/image.jpg";
page.Resources.Images.Add(image);
```
**Explanation:** Load and add an image from a specified path into your PDF document.

### Merging and Splitting Documents

#### Combining Multiple PDFs

**Merge PDF Files:**
```csharp
Document pdf1 = new Document("file1.pdf");
Document pdf2 = new Document("file2.pdf");
// Add pages of the second document to the first
pdf1.Pages.Add(pdf2.Pages);
pdf1.Save("merged.pdf");
```
**Explanation:** This merges `file2.pdf` into `file1.pdf`, saving it as `merged.pdf`.

### Data Extraction

#### Extracting Text from PDFs

**Retrieve Text:**
```csharp
TextAbsorber textAbsorber = new TextAbsorber();
document.Pages.Accept(textAbsorber);
string extractedText = textAbsorber.Text;
