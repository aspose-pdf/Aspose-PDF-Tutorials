#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Create an instance of `FormEditor` and bind it to your PDF document:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
FormEditor form = new FormEditor();
form.BindPdf(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation into manageable steps.

### Setting JavaScript for a Push Button in PDF

#### Overview
This feature allows you to add custom interactivity to your PDF documents by assigning JavaScript to push button fields.

##### Step 1: Initialize FormEditor and Bind PDF
First, create an instance of `FormEditor` and bind it to the PDF document:
```csharp
// Set your document directory path.
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

// Create a new FormEditor object and open the PDF file.
FormEditor form = new FormEditor();
form.BindPdf(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
```

##### Step 2: Assign JavaScript to Push Button
Use `SetFieldScript` to assign an alert script that triggers when the button is pressed:
```csharp
// Add JavaScript to a push button field named 'pushbutton'.
form.SetFieldScript("pushbutton", "app.alert('Hello World!');");
```

##### Step 3: Save the Document
Save your changes to reflect the added interactivity in the PDF document:
```csharp
// Specify the output directory path.
string outputDir = dataDir + "/output";

// Save the updated PDF with JavaScript functionality.
form.Save(outputDir + "/SetJSPushButton_out.pdf");
```

### Loading and Saving a PDF Document with Aspose.PDF Facades

#### Overview
Learn how to load, manipulate, and save PDF documents using Aspose.PDF.

##### Step 1: Load the PDF
Open your existing PDF document by binding it to `FormEditor`:
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Initialize FormEditor.
FormEditor form = new FormEditor();

// Bind an existing PDF file.
form.BindPdf(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
```

##### Step 2: Save the Updated PDF
After making any desired changes, save your document:
```csharp
// Save the updated PDF to the output directory.
form.Save(outputDir + "/UpdatedPDF_out.pdf");
```

## Practical Applications
