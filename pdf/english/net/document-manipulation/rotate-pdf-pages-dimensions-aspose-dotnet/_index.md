### Introduction
In today's digital environment, efficient PDF manipulation is essential for businesses aiming to maintain document integrity while adjusting layouts. Whether you're a developer automating report generation or a business professional managing documentation workflows, mastering PDF transformations can be crucial. This tutorial will guide you through using Aspose.PDF for .NET to rotate PDF pages and retrieve their dimensions effectively.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to use Aspose.PDF for .NET to manipulate PDF documents.
- Steps to add, modify, and extract page dimensions in PDFs.
- Techniques to rotate PDF pages by 90 degrees using C#.
- Best practices for optimizing PDF operations with Aspose.PDF.

Let's explore the prerequisites before implementing these features.

### Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure your environment is set up correctly:

- **Required Libraries:**
  - Aspose.PDF for .NET (latest version recommended)

- **Environment Setup Requirements:**
  - Visual Studio or any compatible IDE
  - .NET Framework or .NET Core/5+/6+ installed

- **Knowledge Prerequisites:**
  - Basic understanding of C# and .NET programming concepts

### Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET
To get started with Aspose.PDF for .NET, you need to install the library. You can use different methods depending on your development setup:

**.NET CLI**

```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Package Manager**

```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
- Search for "Aspose.PDF" in the NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

#### License Acquisition
1. **Free Trial**: Begin with a free trial to explore functionalities.
2. **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license if you need extended access beyond the trial period.
3. **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a full license for ongoing use.

**Basic Initialization:**

```csharp
// Basic Aspose.PDF initialization
using Aspose.Pdf;

var doc = new Document();
```

### Implementation Guide
In this section, we will cover how to rotate PDF pages and retrieve their dimensions using Aspose.PDF in C#.

#### Adding a Blank Page and Retrieving Dimensions
**Overview:**
Let's start by opening an existing PDF document, adding a blank page if necessary, and then retrieving the current dimensions of the page.

1. **Open Document**

   ```csharp
   string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Pages();
   Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "UpdateDimensions.pdf");
   ```

2. **Add Blank Page (if needed)**

   ```csharp
   // Adds a blank page if the document doesn't have one
   Page page = pdfDocument.Pages.Count > 0 ? pdfDocument.Pages[1] : pdfDocument.Pages.Add();
   ```

3. **Retrieve Dimensions**

   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine(page.GetPageRect(true).Width.ToString() + ":" + page.GetPageRect(true).Height);
   ```

#### Rotating a Page
**Overview:**
Rotate the PDF page by 90 degrees and check how dimensions change due to rotation.

1. **Rotate Page**

   ```csharp
   // Rotate page at 90 degree angle
   page.Rotate = Rotation.on90;
   ```

2. **Retrieve New Dimensions**

   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine(page.GetPageRect(true).Width.ToString() + ":" + page.GetPageRect(true).Height);
   ```

### Practical Applications
- **Document Standardization**: Ensure all documents comply with specific layout requirements by rotating and adjusting dimensions.
- **Automated Report Generation**: Rotate pages in automated reports to match presentation standards or user preferences.
- **Integration with Document Management Systems**: Use Aspose.PDF for seamless document transformations within larger system architectures.

### Performance Considerations
When working with PDFs, consider the following to optimize performance:

- Use memory-efficient methods when dealing with large documents.
- Dispose of resources appropriately after processing.
- Leverage Aspose.PDF's built-in functions for optimized manipulation.
