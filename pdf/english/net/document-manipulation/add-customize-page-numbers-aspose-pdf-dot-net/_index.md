## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET (H2)

To use Aspose.PDF, install the package using your preferred method:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```bash
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

#### Basic Initialization
Here's how to initialize Aspose.PDF in your project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

// Initialize the PDF document
document = new Document("input.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide

This section covers adding and customizing page numbers using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

### Add Page Number to a PDF Document (H2)

Add page numbers at the bottom of each page with the format "Page X Of Y".

#### Overview
We'll use `PdfFileStamp` to stamp page numbers on your document. 

**Step 1: Initialize PdfFileStamp**
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

// Create a new PdfFileStamp object
fileStamp = new PdfFileStamp();
fileStamp.BindPdf("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\AddPageNumber.pdf");
```

**Step 2: Get Total Page Count**
Retrieve the total number of pages to format page numbers correctly.
```csharp
int totalPages = new PdfFileInfo("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\AddPageNumber.pdf").NumberOfPages;
```

**Step 3: Format and Add Page Numbers**
Customize your page numbers' appearance by setting their color, font style, and position.
```csharp
using System.Drawing;
using System.Text;

FormattedText formattedText = new FormattedText(
    "Page # Of " + totalPages,
    Color.Blue,
    Color.Gray,
    FontStyle.Courier,
    EncodingType.Winansi,
    false, 14
);

fileStamp.StartingNumber = 1;
fileStamp.AddPageNumber(formattedText, 0); // Position at bottom center

// Save and close the PdfFileStamp object
testDocument.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\AddPageNumber_out.pdf");
testDocument.Close();
```

### Customize Page Number Style in a PDF Document (H2)

Change your page number style, such as using Roman numerals.

#### Overview
You can easily adjust the numbering style with `PdfFileStamp`.

**Step 1: Initialize PdfFileStamp**
Reinitialize if necessary or continue from previous usage.
```csharp
// Assuming fileStamp is already initialized and bound to a PDF document
```

**Step 2: Set Numbering Style**
Choose Roman numerals in uppercase for this example.
```csharp
fileStamp.NumberingStyle = NumberingStyle.NumeralsRomanUppercase;
```

**Step 3: Add Page Numbers with Custom Format**
Apply the custom numbering style to your document.
```csharp
// Adding page numbers with the specified format at bottom center
testDocument.AddPageNumber("#");

// Save and close the PdfFileStamp object
testDocument.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\CustomNumberStyle_out.pdf");
testDocument.Close();
```

## Practical Applications (H2)

Here are scenarios where adding and customizing page numbers is beneficial:
1. **Legal Documents:** Ensure documents have correctly numbered pages for compliance.
2. **Educational Materials:** Create textbooks or manuals with clear pagination.
3. **Publishing Industry:** Automate the numbering process in manuscripts for efficiency.
4. **Corporate Reports:** Enhance readability and navigation in reports.

## Performance Considerations (H2)

When handling large PDFs, optimize performance:
- **Streamlined Code Execution:** Minimize operations within loops to reduce processing time.
- **Memory Management:** Dispose of objects properly using `using` statements or explicit calls to `.Close()` on Aspose.PDF objects.
- **Batch Processing:** Consider batch operations for multiple documents to save resources.
