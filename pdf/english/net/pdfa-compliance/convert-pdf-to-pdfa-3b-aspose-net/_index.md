### Basic Initialization

After installation, initialize Aspose.PDF in your C# project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

// Initialize the Document object
Document pdfDocument = new Document("input.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide

This section will guide you through converting a PDF file to PDF/A-3B format.

### Step 1: Open the Document

Start by loading your PDF document using the `Document` class:

```csharp
// Load an existing PDF document
string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_DocumentConversion();
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

### Step 2: Convert to PDF/A-3B

Use the `Convert` method to transform your document:

```csharp
// Perform conversion to PDF/A-3B format
pdfDocument.Convert(new MemoryStream(), PdfFormat.PDF_A_3B, ConvertErrorAction.Delete);
```
**Explanation**: 
- **MemoryStream**: Represents a stream for reading and writing bytes.
- **PdfFormat.PDF_A_3B**: Specifies the target compliance level.
- **ConvertErrorAction.Delete**: Handles errors by deleting unconvertible elements.

### Step 3: Save the Converted Document

Finally, save your document:

```csharp
// Define output path and save the document
dataDir = dataDir + "PDFToPDFA3b_out.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
```

**Troubleshooting Tips**: 
- Ensure input files are accessible.
- Handle exceptions that may arise during conversion.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases for converting PDFs to PDF/A-3B:
