license.SetLicense("Path to your license file");
```
With these setup steps complete, let's move on to implementing the PDF/X-4 conversion.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Converting a PDF to PDF/X-4 Format

Converting standard PDF documents into PDF/X-4 format ensures compatibility with high-quality printing processes while supporting transparency and color management features. Hereâ€™s how you can implement this using Aspose.PDF for .NET:

#### Overview

The conversion process involves loading the original PDF, setting up PDF/X-4 compliance options, and saving the output.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Open Document**
Begin by opening your source PDF document using Aspose.Pdf.Document class.
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;

string YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Load the original PDF
using (var document = new Document(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY + "/PDFToPDFX.pdf"))
{
    // Conversion steps follow...
}
```
**2. Set Up PDF/X Format**
Configure the conversion options, specifying PDF/X-4 compliance and any additional settings like ICC profiles.
```csharp
// Specify conversion to PDF/X-4 format
PdfFormatConversionOptions options = new PdfFormatConversionOptions(PdfFormat.PDF_X_4, ConvertErrorAction.Delete);

// Optionally, set an external ICC profile for color management
options.IccProfileFileName = YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY + "/ISOcoated_v2_eci.icc";

// Define the OutputIntent properties (optional)
options.OutputIntent = new OutputIntent("FOGRA39");
```
**3. Execute Conversion**
Perform the conversion to ensure your document meets PDF/X-4 standards.
```csharp
// Convert the document
document.Convert(options);
```
**4. Save the Output Document**
Finally, save the converted file to your desired location.
```csharp
// Save the converted document
document.Save(YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY + "/PDFToPDFX4_out.pdf");
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Ensure Compatibility:** Check if your PDF contains elements that are not supported in PDF/X-4.
- **ICC Profile Issues:** Verify the path and format of the ICC profile file to avoid errors.

## Practical Applications

Converting PDFs to PDF/X-4 has several real-world applications:
1. **Graphic Design:** Ensures design integrity when files are sent to print shops.
2. **Archival Projects:** Provides a standardized format for preserving documents over time.
3. **Cross-Platform Publishing:** Facilitates consistent display across different devices and platforms.

## Performance Considerations

When working with Aspose.PDF, keep these tips in mind:
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Manage memory by disposing of objects not in use.
- **Efficient Code Practices:** Use asynchronous methods where possible to improve performance.
- **Memory Management:** Regularly monitor application memory usage and adjust your code accordingly.
