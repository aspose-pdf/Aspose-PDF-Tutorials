Ready to streamline your document management? Let's get started!

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:
- **Libraries & Dependencies**: Aspose.PDF for .NET included in your project.
- **Environment Setup**: A .NET development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of C# and file handling in .NET applications.

### Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET

#### Installation
To start, add the Aspose.PDF library to your project using one of these methods:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Package Manager:**
```powershell

### Implementation Guide

With everything set up, letâ€™s add a custom TOC with page numbers to your PDF document.

#### Load and Modify PDF Document
Firstly, load the existing PDF document into your application. We'll then insert a new page at the beginning of this document for our TOC.

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;

string inFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/42824.pdf";
string outFile = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/42824_out.pdf";

// Load the PDF document
document doc = new Document(inFile);

// Insert a new page at the beginning for TOC
Aspose.Pdf.Page tocPage = doc.Pages.Insert(1);
```

#### Create and Configure Table of Contents Information
Next, configure your TOC by setting up its title, font size, style, and prefixing page numbers.

```csharp
// Set up TOC information
tocInfo tocInfo = new TocInfo();
textFragment title = new TextFragment("Table Of Contents");
title.TextState.FontSize = 20; // Font size for the TOC title
title.TextState.FontStyle = FontStyles.Bold; // Bold style for emphasis
tocInfo.Title = title;
tocInfo.PageNumbersPrefix = "P"; // Prefix page numbers with 'P'
tocPage.TocInfo = tocInfo; // Assign TOC info to the new page
```

#### Add Entries to Table of Contents
Now, populate the TOC with entries for each page in your document.

```csharp
for (int i = 1; i < doc.Pages.Count; i++) {
    Aspose.Pdf.Heading heading2 = new Aspose.Pdf.Heading(1);
textSegment segment2 = new textSegment();

    // Link the heading to TOC page
    heading2.TocPage = tocPage;

    // Add text segment to the heading
    heading2.Segments.Add(segment2); 

    // Set destination page and position for each entry
    heading2.DestinationPage = doc.Pages[i + 1];
    heading2.Top = doc.Pages[i + 1].Rect.Height; 
    segment2.Text = "P" + i.ToString(); // Customized text with prefix 'P'

    // Add the heading to the TOC page
    tocPage.Paragraphs.Add(heading2);
}
```

#### Save Modified PDF Document
Finally, save your modified document with the newly added TOC.

```csharp
doc.Save(outFile);
```

### Practical Applications

Adding a custom TOC can significantly enhance document navigation in various scenarios:
1. **Academic Papers**: Quickly access different sections of lengthy research documents.
2. **User Manuals**: Improve user experience by allowing quick jumps to specific instructions or topics.
3. **Reports and Proposals**: Facilitate easy reference during presentations or reviews.

### Performance Considerations

When working with large PDF files, consider the following for optimal performance:
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Dispose of objects promptly after use to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple documents in batches if possible to streamline processing tasks.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize asynchronous methods where applicable to avoid blocking operations.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to enhance your PDF documents by adding a custom Table of Contents with page numbers using Aspose.PDF for .NET. This capability not only improves document navigation but also enhances overall user experience.

To further explore the capabilities of Aspose.PDF for .NET, consider diving into more complex features and integrations as you become comfortable with the basics.
