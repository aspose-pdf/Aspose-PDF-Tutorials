## Implementation Guide

### Adding a Text Stamp

#### Overview
Adding a text stamp involves creating and configuring a `Stamp` object that can be placed onto specific pages of a PDF document. This feature is useful for branding or marking documents as confidential.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Initialize PdfFileStamp Object

The first step in our process is to initialize the `PdfFileStamp` object, which acts as an interface for working with PDF files.

```csharp
// Step 1: Initialize PdfFileStamp object
PdfFileStamp fileStamp = new PdfFileStamp();
```

**Explanation**: The `PdfFileStamp` class provides methods to add stamps and save changes. It manages resources efficiently by closing connections when done.

##### Open the PDF Document

Next, specify the path to your input PDF document using the `BindPdf` method.

```csharp
// Step 2: Open the PDF document
string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Placeholder for input directory
fileStamp.BindPdf(dataDir + "AddTextStamp-Page.pdf");
```

**Explanation**: The `dataDir` variable should point to your PDF file. Ensure you replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with the actual path.

##### Create and Configure a Text Stamp

Here, we'll create a new `Stamp` object and set its properties for text content, color, font style, and positioning.

```csharp
// Step 3: Create and configure a text stamp
Aspose.Pdf.Facades.Stamp stamp = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.Stamp();
stamp.BindLogo(new FormattedText(
    "Hello World!", 
    Color.Blue, 
    Color.Gray, 
    FontStyle.Helvetica, 
    EncodingType.Winansi, 
    true, 14));
stamp.SetOrigin(200, 200); // Position of the stamp on the page
stamp.Rotation = 90.0F; // Rotation angle in degrees
stamp.IsBackground = true; // Place the stamp behind the content
```

**Explanation**: The `FormattedText` constructor defines the text properties, such as color and font. Adjust the origin coordinates to position the stamp exactly where you need it.

##### Specify Pages for the Stamp

You can limit which pages receive the stamp by setting the `Pages` property of the `Stamp` object.

```csharp
// Step 4: Specify which pages to add the stamp to
stamp.Pages = new int[] { 1 };
```

**Explanation**: This example adds a stamp only to the first page. Modify the array to include additional or different pages as needed.

##### Add the Stamp and Save

Finally, apply the configured stamp to your document and save it.

```csharp
// Step 5: Add the stamp to the PDF document
fileStamp.AddStamp(stamp);

// Step 6: Save the updated PDF document
string outputDir = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Placeholder for output directory
fileStamp.Save(outputDir + "AddTextStamp-Page_out.pdf");

// Step 7: Close the PdfFileStamp object to release resources
fileStamp.Close();
```

**Explanation**: Always remember to close the `PdfFileStamp` to free up system resources. The final document will be saved at the specified output directory.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing References**: Ensure Aspose.PDF is correctly referenced in your project.
- **Path Issues**: Double-check file paths for typos or incorrect directories.
- **Memory Errors**: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and release resources promptly.

## Practical Applications

Adding text stamps with Aspose.PDF can be beneficial in various scenarios:

1. **Branding Documents**: Embed company logos or messages on all outgoing documents.
2. **Confidentiality Marking**: Label sensitive information as confidential across multiple pages.
3. **Document Version Control**: Add version numbers to track document revisions.
4. **Legal Documentation**: Stamp legal disclaimers or terms of use.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance while working with Aspose.PDF:

- Process only necessary pages when possible to reduce memory usage.
- Release resources promptly by closing `PdfFileStamp` objects after operations.
- Use efficient data structures and methods tailored for handling large PDF files.
