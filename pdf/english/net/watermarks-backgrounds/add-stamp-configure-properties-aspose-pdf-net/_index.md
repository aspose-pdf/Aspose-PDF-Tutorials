# How to Add a Stamp and Configure Document Properties in PDFs Using Aspose.PDF for .NET

## Introduction

Enhancing your PDF documents with stamps or watermarks and configuring essential properties like author and title can be crucial for professional documentation. This tutorial will guide you through adding stamps and setting document properties using Aspose.PDF for .NET, a powerful library that simplifies PDF manipulation in .NET environments.

In this guide, you'll learn:
- How to add a stamp to specific pages of your PDF documents.
- Configuring basic document properties such as author and title.
- The necessary setup and installation steps for Aspose.PDF for .NET.

Let's start with the prerequisites before diving into implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:
- **Required Libraries**: Install the Aspose.PDF library. Ensure your project targets a compatible .NET framework version.
- **Environment Setup**: Use a development environment like Visual Studio or any other IDE supporting .NET projects.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: A basic understanding of C# and .NET programming will be helpful.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET

### Installation Information

To use Aspose.PDF for .NET, add the package via:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

Consider acquiring a license. Start with a free trial to evaluate Aspose.PDF:

- **Purchase**: If you find the library fits your needs, purchase a full license on [Aspose's Purchase Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization

To initialize Aspose.PDF in your project:
1. Import the necessary namespaces.
2. Load or create PDF documents using `Document` class.

Hereâ€™s how to set up an initial document:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

// Initialize a new Document object
Document pdfDocument = new Document();
```

## Implementation Guide

### Add PDF Page Stamp

#### Overview
Adding a stamp can enhance your document's visual appeal or provide additional information like version details.

#### Steps to Add a Stamp
**1. Load Your PDF Document**
Start by opening an existing PDF document from your directory:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

// Open the existing PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/PDFPageStamp.pdf");
```

**2. Create and Configure PdfPageStamp Object**
Create a `PdfPageStamp` object for the desired page (e.g., page 1) and set its properties:
```csharp
// Create a PdfPageStamp object for page 1 of the document
PdfPageStamp pageStamp = new PdfPageStamp(pdfDocument.Pages[1]);

// Set stamp properties: background, position, and rotation angle
pageStamp.Background = true;
pageStamp.XIndent = 100; // X-axis indentation
pageStamp.YIndent = 100; // Y-axis indentation
pageStamp.Rotate = Rotation.on180; // Rotate the stamp by 180 degrees
```

**3. Add the Stamp to the Page**
Add the configured stamp object to your selected page:
```csharp
// Add the created stamp to page 1 of the PDF document
pdfDocument.Pages[1].AddStamp(pageStamp);
```

**4. Save Your Document**
Define an output path and save your modified document:
```csharp
string outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/PDFPageStamp_out.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(outputPath);
```

### Configure Document Properties

#### Overview
Configuring properties like author, title, or keywords is essential for managing PDF metadata.

#### Steps to Configure Document Properties
**1. Load Your PDF Document**
Open an existing PDF document as before:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

// Open an existing PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Sample.pdf");
```

**2. Set Document Properties**
Adjust the properties as needed, such as setting the author and title:
```csharp
// Set some document properties like author and title
pdfDocument.Info.Author = "Author Name";
pdfDocument.Info.Title = "Sample Title";
```

**3. Save Your Modified Document**
Specify an output path and save your changes:
```csharp
string outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/Configured_Sample.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(outputPath);
```

## Practical Applications

Adding stamps and configuring properties can be useful in scenarios like watermarking PDFs for confidentiality, automating reports with dynamic data, or organizing documents by setting meaningful metadata.

## Performance Considerations

When using Aspose.PDF for .NET, consider:
- **Efficient Memory Use**: Dispose of objects when no longer needed.
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple PDFs in batches if processing large volumes.
- **Optimize I/O Operations**: Keep documents in memory to minimize read/write operations.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to add stamps and configure document properties using Aspose.PDF for .NET. These skills are vital for creating professional PDF files. To further your knowledge, explore more features of Aspose.PDF or integrate them into larger projects.

Next steps could include exploring other document manipulation capabilities like merging, splitting, or securing PDFs.
