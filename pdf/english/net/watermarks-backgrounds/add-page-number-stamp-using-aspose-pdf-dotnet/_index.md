## Implementation Guide
Now that your environment is set up, let’s implement the feature to add a page number stamp.

### Opening the Document
Firstly, load the PDF document you want to modify:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

// Load an existing PDF document
document = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/PageNumberStamp.pdf");
```

### Creating and Configuring the Page Number Stamp
The goal is to create a page number stamp that appears on each page of your PDF, aiding in navigation.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### Create the Page Number Stamp
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;

// Initialize a new instance of the PageNumberStamp class
pageNumberStamp = new PageNumberStamp();
```

##### Set Stamp Properties
Configure various properties to customize your page number stamp:
```csharp
// Ensure the stamp is in the foreground
pageNumberStamp.Background = false;

// Format the text of the stamp
pageNumberStamp.Format = "Page # of " + document.Pages.Count;

// Define the margin from the bottom of the page
pageNumberStamp.BottomMargin = 10;

// Center the stamp horizontally
pageNumberStamp.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center;

// Start numbering from page 1
pageNumberStamp.StartingNumber = 1;
```

##### Customize Text Appearance
Set the font, size, style, and color to make your stamp stand out:
```csharp
// Set font, size, and style
pageNumberStamp.TextState.Font = FontRepository.FindFont("Arial");
pageNumberStamp.TextState.FontSize = 14.0F;
pageNumberStamp.TextState.FontStyle = FontStyles.Bold | FontStyles.Italic;

// Choose a text color
pageNumberStamp.TextState.ForegroundColor = Color.Aqua;
```

##### Add Stamp to Pages
Apply the stamp to every page in your document:
```csharp
foreach (Page page in document.Pages)
{
    // Add the configured stamp to each page
    page.AddStamp(pageNumberStamp);
}
```

### Save the Document
After adding the stamp, save your PDF with the changes:
```csharp
// Save the updated document to a specified path
document.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/PageNumberStamp_out.pdf");
```

## Practical Applications
Adding page numbers is useful for organizing pages. Here are some real-world use cases:
1. **Legal Documents**: Ensures easy reference and verification during reviews.
2. **Books and Publications**: Facilitates navigation, especially in printed versions.
3. **Reports and Presentations**: Enhances professionalism by maintaining structure.

When working with large PDF files or batch processing multiple documents:
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Dispose of objects that are no longer needed to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing Tips**: Process documents in batches to avoid memory overload.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use asynchronous methods where possible to improve performance.
