```

Now that we've got our environment ready, let’s walk through implementing the license using FileStream.

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll break down the process of setting your Aspose.PDF license step-by-step.

### Overview: Setting a License with FileStream

Setting an Aspose.PDF .NET license using FileStream is essential for activating all features without limitations. This method offers flexibility in managing your licensing file directly from code.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your License File
Ensure you have the license file `Aspose.Pdf.net.lic` accessible on your system, typically stored at a path like `c:\Keys\`.

#### Step 2: Initialize and Set the License

Here's how to load your license using FileStream:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Pdf;

public class LoadLicenseFromStreamObject
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        // The path to the documents directory.
        string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_QuickStart();

        // Initialize license object
        License license = new License();
        
        // Load license in FileStream
        using (FileStream myStream = new FileStream(@"c:\Keys\Aspose.Pdf.net.lic", FileMode.Open))
        {
            // Set the license
            license.SetLicense(myStream);
        }

        Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **FileStream Initialization**: Opens your license file in read mode.
- **SetLicense Method**: This method takes a FileStream as an argument, applying the license to Aspose.PDF for .NET.
  
#### Step 3: Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter issues:
- Verify the path to your license file is correct and accessible.
- Ensure that the license file isn't corrupted or expired.
