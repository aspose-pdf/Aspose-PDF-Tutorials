//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to extract an image from a PDF document and save it as a JPEG file while also saving the updated PDF.
//ExStepSummary:0: The following code initializes the path to the documents directory.
//ExStepSummary:1: The following code opens the PDF document from which images will be extracted.
//ExStepSummary:2: The following code extracts a specific image from the PDF document.
//ExStepSummary:3: The following code saves the extracted image to a specified output file.
//ExStepSummary:4: The following code updates the original PDF file and saves it to a new path.
//ExStepImage:3: images/1.png
//ExStep:0-
// Specifies the directory containing the PDF file
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Opens the PDF document for image extraction
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "ExtractImages.pdf");

//ExStep:2-
// Extracts the first image from the second page of the PDF
XImage xImage = pdfDocument.Pages[1].Resources.Images[1];

//ExStep:3-
// Creates a stream to save the extracted image
FileStream outputImage = new FileStream(dataDir + "output.jpg", FileMode.Create);

// Save output image
xImage.Save(outputImage, ImageFormat.Jpeg); 
// Closes the file stream to release resources
outputImage.Close();

//ExStep:4-
// Updates the path for the new version of the PDF
dataDir = dataDir + "ExtractImages_out.pdf";

// Save updated PDF file
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
// Confirms the successful extraction and saving of files
Console.WriteLine("\nImages extracted successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
