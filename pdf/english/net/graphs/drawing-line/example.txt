//ExStart
//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to create a PDF document using Aspose.PDF by drawing two diagonal lines across the page. It initializes a document, adds a page, and draws lines from corner to corner before saving the document.
//ExStepSummary:0: Initialize the path for the documents directory where the PDF will be saved.
//ExStepSummary:1: Create a new Document instance for the PDF.
//ExStepSummary:2: Add a page to the document's pages collection.
//ExStepSummary:3: Set the page margins to zero for all sides.
//ExStepSummary:4: Create a Graph object to represent the drawing area with dimensions equal to the page size.
//ExStepSummary:5: Create the first line object from the lower-left to the top-right corner of the page.
//ExStepSummary:6: Add the first line to the shapes collection of the Graph object.
//ExStepSummary:7: Create the second line object from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the page.
//ExStepSummary:8: Add the second line to the shapes collection of the Graph object.
//ExStepSummary:9: Add the Graph object containing the lines to the page's paragraphs collection.
//ExStepSummary:10: Construct the full path for saving the output PDF file.
//ExStepSummary:11: Save the PDF document to the specified path.

//ExStep:0-
// Initialize the path for the documents directory
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Create Document instance
Document pDoc = new Document();

//ExStep:2-
// Add page to pages collection of PDF document
Page pg = pDoc.Pages.Add();

//ExStep:3-
// Set page margin on all sides as 0
pg.PageInfo.Margin.Left = pg.PageInfo.Margin.Right =
    pg.PageInfo.Margin.Bottom = pg.PageInfo.Margin.Top = 0;

//ExStep:4-
// Create Graph object with Width and Height equal to page dimensions
Aspose.Pdf.Drawing.Graph graph = new Aspose.Pdf.Drawing.Graph(pg.PageInfo.Width, pg.PageInfo.Height);

//ExStep:5-
// Create first line object starting from Lower-Left to Top-Right corner of page
Aspose.Pdf.Drawing.Line line = new Aspose.Pdf.Drawing.Line(new float[] { (float)pg.Rect.LLX, 0, (float)pg.PageInfo.Width, (float)pg.Rect.URY });

//ExStep:6-
graph.Shapes.Add(line); // Add first line to shapes collection of Graph object

//ExStep:7-
// Draw line from Top-Left corner of page to Bottom-Right corner of page
Aspose.Pdf.Drawing.Line line2 = new Aspose.Pdf.Drawing.Line(new float[] { 0, (float)pg.Rect.URY, (float)pg.PageInfo.Width, (float)pg.Rect.LLX });

//ExStep:8-
// Add second line to shapes collection of Graph object
graph.Shapes.Add(line2);

//ExStep:9-
// Add Graph object to paragraphs collection of page
pg.Paragraphs.Add(graph);

//ExStep:10-
// Construct the full path for saving the output PDF file
dataDir = dataDir + "DrawingLine_out.pdf";

//ExStep:11-
// Save the PDF file
pDoc.Save(dataDir);
// Output confirmation message
Console.WriteLine("\nLine drawn successfully across the page.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
