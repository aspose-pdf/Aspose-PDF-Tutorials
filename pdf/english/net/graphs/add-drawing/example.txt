//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to create a PDF document with a graph containing a rectangle filled with a transparent color. It walks through the process of setting up color properties, adding pages, and drawing shapes in the document.
//ExStepSummary:0: The following code initializes the data directory for saving the PDF file.
//ExStepSummary:1: The following code sets up the Alpha RGB color to be used for the rectangle's fill.
//ExStepSummary:2: The following code creates a new Document object for the PDF.
//ExStepSummary:3: The following code adds a page to the PDF document.
//ExStepSummary:4: The following code creates a Graph object for drawing shapes in the PDF.
//ExStepSummary:5: The following code sets a border for the graph object.
//ExStepSummary:6: The following code adds the graph object to the page's paragraphs collection.
//ExStepSummary:7: The following code creates a rectangle shape to be drawn on the graph.
//ExStepSummary:8: The following code sets color information for the rectangle's graph information.
//ExStepSummary:9: The following code adds the rectangle shape to the graph's shapes collection.
//ExStepSummary:10: The following code saves the document to the specified output file path.

//ExStep:0-
// Initializing the path for saving the document
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Alpha channel value for transparency
int alpha = 10;
int green = 0;
int red = 100;
int blue = 0;

// Create Color object using Alpha RGB
Aspose.Pdf.Color alphaColor = Aspose.Pdf.Color.FromArgb(alpha, red, green, blue);

//ExStep:2-
// Instantiate Document object
Document document = new Document();

//ExStep:3-
// Add a new page to the document
Page page = document.Pages.Add();

//ExStep:4-
// Create Graph object with specific dimensions
Aspose.Pdf.Drawing.Graph graph = new Aspose.Pdf.Drawing.Graph(300.0, 400.0);

//ExStep:5-
// Set border for the Graph object
graph.Border = (new Aspose.Pdf.BorderInfo(Aspose.Pdf.BorderSide.All, Aspose.Pdf.Color.Black));

//ExStep:6-
// Add the graph object to the page
page.Paragraphs.Add(graph);

//ExStep:7-
// Create Rectangle object with specific dimensions
Aspose.Pdf.Drawing.Rectangle rectangle = new Aspose.Pdf.Drawing.Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 50);

//ExStep:8-
// Create graphInfo object for the Rectangle
Aspose.Pdf.GraphInfo graphInfo = rectangle.GraphInfo; 

// Set color information for GraphInfo instance
graphInfo.Color = (Aspose.Pdf.Color.Red); // Set the border color for the rectangle
graphInfo.FillColor = (alphaColor); // Set the fill color with transparency

//ExStep:9-
// Add the rectangle shape to the graph
graph.Shapes.Add(rectangle);

//ExStep:10-
// Set the output file path for saving the document
dataDir = dataDir + "AddDrawing_out.pdf";
document.Save(dataDir); // Save the document to the specified output path

//ExStep:11-
// Confirmation message
Console.WriteLine("\nDrawing added successfully with transparent color.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
