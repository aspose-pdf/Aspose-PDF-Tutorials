## Create PDF with Rectangles & Alpha Colors in Aspose.PDF

Aspose.PDF for .NET is a powerful library for creating, manipulating, and converting PDF documents in C#. In this example, you'll learn how to create a PDF file and draw rectangles with alpha colors. We use the `Aspose.Pdf.Drawing.Graph` class to add shapes and apply transparency effects using ARGB colors. This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide with sample code, ensuring you can easily implement it in your .NET applications.
