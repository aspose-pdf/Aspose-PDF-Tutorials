- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with PDF document structures.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET

To integrate Aspose.PDF into your project, you need to install the library. Here's how:

### Installation Options

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:** Search for "Aspose.PDF" in your NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To use Aspose.PDF without evaluation limitations, you can acquire a temporary license or purchase a full one. Here's how:
- **Free Trial:** Access limited functionality to test features.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain it [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for full-feature access during your trial period.
- **Purchase:** Consider purchasing if you find Aspose.PDF meets your needs.

### Basic Initialization

Once installed, initialize a new Document object in your C# project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

Document doc = new Document();
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll explore three key features: configuring document settings, rendering tables with fixed content, and creating tables on new pages.

### Feature 1: Configure Document Settings

#### Overview
Setting the right margins and orientation ensures your PDF looks professional. This feature allows you to adjust these properties effortlessly.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1:** Initialize Document and PageInfo
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

string YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
PageInfo pageInfo = doc.PageInfo;
MarginInfo marginInfo = pageInfo.Margin;
```
**Step 2:** Set Margins and Orientation
```csharp
// Adjust margins in points (1 inch = 72 points)
marginInfo.Left = 37; // Equivalent to 0.5 inches
marginInfo.Right = 37;
marginInfo.Top = 37;
marginInfo.Bottom = 37;

// Change orientation to landscape
pageInfo.IsLandscape = true;
```
**Step 3:** Save Document
```csharp
Page curPage = doc.Pages.Add();
string outputFilePath = YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY + "/DocumentConfiguration_out.pdf";
doc.Save(outputFilePath);
```
### Feature 2: Render Table with Fixed Content

#### Overview
Tables are crucial for presenting structured data. This feature demonstrates how to create a table and populate it consistently.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1:** Create Document and Add Page
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;

string YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

Document doc = new Document();
Page curPage = doc.Pages.Add();
Aspose.Pdf.Paragraphs paragraphs = curPage.Paragraphs;
```
**Step 2:** Define Table Structure
```csharp
// Initialize table with specified column widths (points)
Aspose.Pdf.Table table = new Aspose.Pdf.Table { ColumnWidths = "50 100" };
```
**Step 3:** Populate Rows and Cells
```csharp
for (int i = 1; i <= 120; i++)
{
    Aspose.Pdf.Row row = table.Rows.Add();
    row.FixedRowHeight = 15;

    // Add text to cells
    Aspose.Pdf.Cell cell1 = row.Cells.Add();
    cell1.Paragraphs.Add(new TextFragment("Content 1"));

    Aspose.Pdf.Cell cell2 = row.Cells.Add();
    cell2.Paragraphs.Add(new TextFragment("HHHHH"));
}
paragraphs.Add(table);
```
**Step 4:** Save Document
```csharp
string outputFilePath = YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY + "/RenderTableWithFixedContent_out.pdf";
doc.Save(outputFilePath);
```
### Feature 3: Render Table with New Page Property

#### Overview
Positioning tables on new pages can enhance readability and organization. This feature demonstrates how to achieve this using Aspose.PDF.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1:** Create Document and Add Initial Page
```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
Page curPage = doc.Pages.Add();
Aspose.Pdf.Paragraphs paragraphs = curPage.Paragraphs;
```
**Step 2:** Define Table Layout
```csharp
// Initialize table with column widths
Aspose.Pdf.Table table1 = new Aspose.Pdf.Table { ColumnWidths = "100 100" };
```
**Step 3:** Populate Rows and Cells
```csharp
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
    Aspose.Pdf.Row row = table1.Rows.Add();
    
    // Add text to cells
    Aspose.Pdf.Cell cell1 = row.Cells.Add();
    cell1.Paragraphs.Add(new TextFragment("LAAAAAAA"));

    Aspose.Pdf.Cell cell2 = row.Cells.Add();
    cell2.Paragraphs.Add(new TextFragment("LAAGGGGGG"));
}
```
**Step 4:** Set Table to New Page
```csharp
// Ensure the table starts on a new page
table1.IsInNewPage = true;
paragraphs.Add(table1);
```
**Step 5:** Save Document
```csharp
string outputFilePath = YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY + "/RenderTableWithNewPageProperty_out.pdf";
doc.Save(outputFilePath);
```
