## Implementation Guide

In this section, we will guide you through creating a styled PDF table using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

### Creating and Configuring a PDF Table

#### Overview

We'll start by creating a new PDF document and setting up a table with customized borders and aligned content.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Document

Begin by initializing an instance of the `Document` class, representing your PDF file:
```csharp
// Create PDF document
Document doc = new Document();
```

#### Step 2: Set Up the Table

Create a table object and configure its borders for visual appeal:
```csharp
// Initialize a new instance of the Table
Table table = new Table();

// Set the table border color to LightGray
table.Border = new BorderInfo(BorderSide.All, 0.5f, Color.FromRgb(System.Drawing.Color.LightGray));

// Set borders for table cells
table.DefaultCellBorder = new BorderInfo(BorderSide.All, 0.5f, Color.FromRgb(System.Drawing.Color.LightGray));
```

#### Step 3: Add Rows with Aligned Content

Iterate to add rows and align content within each cell:
```csharp
// Loop to add rows with aligned content
for (int row_count = 0; row_count < 10; row_count++) {
    // Add a row to the table
    Row row = table.Rows.Add();
    
    // Center-align text in each cell of the row
    row.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center;
    
    // Add cells with content
    row.Cells.Add("Column (" + row_count + ", 1)" + DateTime.Now.Ticks);
    row.Cells.Add("Column (" + row_count + ", 2)");
    row.Cells.Add("Column (" + row_count + ", 3)");
}
```

### Adding the Table to a Page and Saving

#### Overview

Finally, add your table to a new page in the document and save it.

#### Step 4: Add the Table to a Page

```csharp
// Add table object to the first page of the document
Page tocPage = doc.Pages.Add();
tocPage.Paragraphs.Add(table);
```

#### Step 5: Save the Document

Specify your desired output path and save the PDF:
```csharp
// Save updated document containing the table object
string outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/43620_ByWords_out.pdf";
doc.Save(outputFilePath);
```
