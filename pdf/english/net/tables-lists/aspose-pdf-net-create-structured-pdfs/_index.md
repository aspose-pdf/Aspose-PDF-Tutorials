After installing Aspose.PDF, initialize your project by creating an instance of the `Document` class. This will serve as a foundation for adding structured elements to your PDF.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Creating and Configuring a PDF Document with Tagged Content

#### Overview
Creating a new PDF document involves setting up essential metadata like title and language, which are crucial for accessibility and SEO.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

##### Step 3.1: Create a New Document Instance
```csharp
Document document = new Document();
```
Here, you create an instance of the `Document` class, which acts as your PDF file.

##### Step 3.2: Access and Configure Tagged Content
```csharp
ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.TaggedContent;
taggedContent.SetTitle("Tagged Pdf Document");
taggedContent.SetLanguage("en-US");
```
Access the `TaggedContent` property of your document to set metadata properties such as title and language, enhancing both accessibility and SEO.

### Feature 2: Adding Structure Elements to a Tagged PDF

#### Overview
Adding structure elements like sections and headers is essential for creating logical content flow within your PDFs. 

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

##### Step 3.3: Access the Root Element
```csharp
StructureElement rootElement = taggedContent.RootElement;
```
Start by accessing the `RootElement` where you’ll append all structured elements.

##### Step 3.4: Create and Append a Section
```csharp
SectElement sect = taggedContent.CreateSectElement();
rootElement.AppendChild(sect);
```
Create sections to logically divide your content, making it easier for screen readers and search engines to navigate the document.

##### Step 3.5: Add a Header Element
```csharp
HeaderElement h1 = taggedContent.CreateHeaderElement(1);
h1.SetText("The Header");
h1.Title = "Title";
h1.Language = "en-US";
// Additional properties
h1.AlternativeText = "Alternative Text";
h1.ExpansionText = "Expansion Text";
h1.ActualText = "Actual Text";
sect.AppendChild(h1);
```
Headers provide semantic meaning to the document’s structure. Here, you set various properties to enhance accessibility and SEO.

### Feature 3: Saving a Tagged PDF Document

#### Overview
Once your PDF is structured with tagged content, save it to ensure all modifications are persisted.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

##### Step 3.6: Save the Structured Document
```csharp
string outputFile = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/StructureElementsProperties.pdf";
document.Save(outputFile);
```
Use the `Save` method to persist your changes to a specified directory, ensuring that all structured elements are maintained.
