### Basic Initialization
Once installed and licensed, initialize your PDF document as follows:
```csharp

// Create a new Document instance
Document document = new Document();
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation into two main features: creating a basic table and setting double borders on cells.

### Feature 1: Basic Table Creation in Aspose.PDF

#### Overview
Creating a PDF table involves adding rows, columns, and content. This section demonstrates how to set up a simple table with one cell of text.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Create Document and Add Page**
```csharp
// Instantiate the Document object
Document document = new Document();
// Add a page to the PDF document
Page page = document.Pages.Add();
```

**Set Up Table Structure**
```csharp
// Instantiate Table object with specified column widths
Aspose.Pdf.Table table = new Aspose.Pdf.Table();
table.ColumnWidths = "100";  // Define the width of columns

// Add a row and cell to the table
Row row = table.Rows.Add();
Cell cell = row.Cells.Add("some text");
```

**Add Table to Document**
```csharp
// Append the table to the page's paragraphs collection
page.Paragraphs.Add(table);
```

### Feature 2: Set Double Border for a Cell

#### Overview
This feature focuses on customizing cell borders within your PDF tables, specifically setting double lines on all sides of a cell.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Create and Customize Border**
```csharp
// Create a new BorderInfo object with double borders on all sides
Aspose.Pdf.BorderInfo border = new Aspose.Pdf.BorderInfo(Aspose.Pdf.BorderSide.All);
border.Top.IsDoubled = true;
border.Bottom.IsDoubled = true;

// Assign the custom border to a cell
cell.Border = border;
```

**Save the Document**
```csharp
// Define output directory and file path
string dataDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/TableBorderTest_out.pdf";

// Save the PDF document
document.Save(dataDir);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Aspose.PDF References**: Ensure you've installed the latest package via NuGet.
- **License Errors**: Double-check your license file path and initialization.

## Practical Applications
1. **Invoices**: Use double borders for emphasis on key data points like totals or due dates in financial documents.
2. **Reports**: Highlight important metrics or sections to guide readers' attention effectively.
3. **Scheduling Tables**: Differentiate between standard entries and highlighted events with border styling.

Integration possibilities include:
- Automating report generation from database queries
- Merging styled tables into existing PDF workflows using Aspose.PDF's extensive features

## Performance Considerations
When working with large documents or complex tables, consider these best practices:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of objects when no longer needed.
- Use stream processing for handling very large PDFs to reduce memory footprint.
- Leverage Aspose.PDFâ€™s performance settings to tune the library based on your specific needs.
