# Create PDFs in .NET Using Aspose: Add Tables and Images Easily

In today's digital age, efficiently managing document workflows is crucial across industries. Whether generating reports, invoices, or presentations, creating professional-looking PDFs with embedded content like tables and images is often essential. This tutorial guides you through using Aspose.PDF for .NET to effortlessly create dynamic PDFs.

## What You'll Learn
- How to instantiate and manipulate PDF documents in .NET.
- Steps to add a table to your PDF document.
- Techniques for embedding an image alongside text within a table cell.
- Optimize performance when working with Aspose.PDF in .NET applications.

Before diving into creating our first PDF, let's review the prerequisites!

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:
- **Aspose.PDF for .NET Library**: Install this library to work with PDF documents.
- **Development Environment**: A C# development environment set up on your machine. Visual Studio is recommended.
- **Basic Knowledge of C#**: Familiarity with C# programming and object-oriented concepts will be beneficial.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for .NET
To start creating PDFs, you must first install the Aspose.PDF library in your project. Here's how:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

**Via NuGet Package Manager UI:**
1. Open your project in Visual Studio.
2. Navigate to the "NuGet Package Manager".
3. Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
To fully utilize Aspose.PDF's capabilities, you may need a license:
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to test features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended testing (useful for development).
- **Purchase**: For production use, purchase a full license.

### Basic Initialization
Here's how you can initialize the Aspose.PDF library in your project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

// Initialize document object
document doc = new Document();
```

## Implementation Guide
Now letâ€™s walk through implementing PDF features using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

### Creating and Instantiating a PDF Document and Page
#### Overview
Creating a PDF starts with instantiating the `Document` class, representing your entire PDF. Adding pages is straightforward by leveraging the `Pages` collection of the `Document`.

**Steps to Implement:**
##### Step 1: Create a New PDF Document
```csharp
// Instantiate document object 
document doc = new Document();
```
This step initializes a blank PDF document.

##### Step 2: Add a Page
```csharp
// Create a page in the Pdf 
Page page = doc.Pages.Add();
```
Here, we add a new page to our document. The `Pages` collection allows you to manage and manipulate all pages within your PDF file easily.

##### Step 3: Save the Document
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
doc.Save(outputDirectory + "/NewDocumentPage.pdf");
```
Finally, save your newly created PDF to a specified directory. Ensure `outputDirectory` is set correctly to avoid errors.

### Creating and Adding a Table to a PDF Page
#### Overview
Tables are essential for displaying data systematically in documents. Aspose.PDF allows you to create tables with specific properties like column widths, margins, and cell padding.

**Steps to Implement:**
##### Step 1: Create Document and Add a Page
```csharp
// Instantiate document object 
document doc = new Document();
Page page = doc.Pages.Add();
```
Recreate the PDF document and add an initial page as before.

##### Step 2: Instantiate a Table Object
```csharp
Table table1 = new Table();
page.Paragraphs.Add(table1);
table1.ColumnWidths = "120 270";
```
Create a `Table` object, set its column widths, and add it to the PDF page. This setup helps define the structure of your table.

##### Step 3: Configure Margins
```csharp
MarginInfo margin = new MarginInfo() {
    Top = 5f,
    Left = 5f,
    Right = 5f,
    Bottom = 5f
};
table1.DefaultCellPadding = margin;
```
Setting margins ensures that content within table cells is appropriately spaced, enhancing readability.

##### Step 4: Save the Document
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
doc.Save(outputDirectory + "/DocumentWithTable.pdf");
```
Save your document as done previously. Make sure to replace `outputDirectory` with a valid path.

### Adding an Image and Text Around It in a Table Cell
#### Overview
Embedding images alongside text within table cells can make your PDFs more engaging. This section demonstrates adding an image next to HTML-formatted text in a table cell.

**Steps to Implement:**
##### Step 1: Set Up Document, Page, and Table
```csharp
document doc = new Document();
Page page = doc.Pages.Add();

Table table1 = new Table();
page.Paragraphs.Add(table1);
table1.ColumnWidths = "120 270";

MarginInfo margin = new MarginInfo() {
    Top = 5f,
    Left = 5f,
    Right = 5f,
    Bottom = 5f
};
table1.DefaultCellPadding = margin;
```
Initialize your document, add a page and table as done in previous sections.

##### Step 2: Add Image to Table Cell
```csharp
Row row1 = table1.Rows.Add();
Image logo = new Image();
logo.File = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/aspose-logo.jpg";
logo.FixHeight = 120;
logo.FixWidth = 110;

row1.Cells.Add();
row1.Cells[0].Paragraphs.Add(logo);
```
Create a `Row`, add an image object, and specify its properties such as file path and dimensions. Then, add the image to your table cell.

##### Step 3: Add HTML-Formatted Text
```csharp
string TitleString = "<font face=\"Arial\" size=6 color=\"#101090\"><b> Aspose.Pdf for .NET</b></font>";
string BodyString1 = "<font face=\"Arial\" size=2><br/>Aspose.Pdf for .NET is a non-graphical PDF document reporting component...</font>";

HtmlFragment TitleText = new HtmlFragment(TitleString + BodyString1);
row1.Cells.Add();
row1.Cells[1].Paragraphs.Add(TitleText);

row1.Cells[1].VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top;
```
Create HTML strings for text and use `HtmlFragment` to add these strings alongside the image in another cell within the same row.

##### Step 4: Save Your Document
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
doc.Save(outputDirectory + "/PlacingTextAroundImage.pdf");
```
Save your final document. Ensure you replace `outputDirectory` with a valid path to avoid file saving issues.

## Practical Applications
Aspose.PDF for .NET can be used in various real-world scenarios:
1. **Automated Report Generation**: Automatically create PDF reports from data sources like databases or spreadsheets.
2. **Invoice Creation**: Generate professional invoices, embedding company logos and detailed transaction records in tabular format.
3. **Marketing Brochures**: Design visually appealing brochures with images and text formatted in tables for product descriptions.

Integration possibilities include linking with CRM systems to pull customer data directly into PDFs or integrating with e-commerce platforms for order summaries.

## Performance Considerations
When using Aspose.PDF, consider these tips to optimize performance:
- **Streamline Memory Usage**: Dispose of objects when they're no longer needed to free up memory.
- **Batch Processing**: Process documents in batches if dealing with large volumes to enhance efficiency.
- **Optimize Image Sizes**: Resize images before embedding them into PDFs to improve loading times and reduce file size.

## Conclusion
Creating PDFs with tables and images using Aspose.PDF for .NET is straightforward once you understand the basics. By following this guide, you can efficiently generate professional-looking documents tailored to your needs. Explore further features of Aspose.PDF to enhance your document processing capabilities.
