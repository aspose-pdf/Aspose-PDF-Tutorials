## Implementation Guide

### Embedding Standard Type 1 Fonts

Embedding fonts is crucial for maintaining document integrity and appearance across different platforms. This feature ensures your text appears consistently, regardless of where the PDF is viewed.

#### Step-by-Step Process

**Load Your Existing Document**

Start by loading the PDF you want to modify:
```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.pdf");
```

**Set Embed Standard Fonts Property**

Ensure that standard type 1 fonts are embedded into your document:
```csharp
pdfDocument.EmbedStandardFonts = true;
```

**Iterate Through Pages and Fonts**

Next, iterate through each page and its font resources to embed the necessary fonts:
```csharp
foreach (Page page in pdfDocument.Pages)
{
    if (page.Resources.Fonts != null)
    {
        foreach (Text.Font pageFont in page.Resources.Fonts)
        {
            // Embed the font if it is not already embedded
            if (!pageFont.IsEmbedded)
            {
                pageFont.IsEmbedded = true;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This ensures that all fonts used in your document are embedded, preserving their appearance.

**Save the Updated Document**

Finally, save your updated PDF:
```csharp
pdfDocument.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/EmbeddedFonts-updated_out.pdf");
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Fonts**: Ensure the font files are accessible and correctly referenced.
- **Performance Issues**: When working with large documents, consider optimizing resource usage by selectively embedding fonts.

## Practical Applications

Embedding Type 1 fonts is not just about aesthetics; it has practical applications too:

1. **Legal Documents**: Ensures that legal terms are displayed uniformly across all devices.
2. **Financial Reports**: Maintains the integrity of financial data presentation.
3. **Marketing Materials**: Keeps branding consistent in distributed PDFs.

Integrating with systems like CRM or document management solutions can streamline workflows and enhance consistency.

## Performance Considerations

When embedding fonts, consider these performance tips:
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Only embed necessary fonts to minimize file size.
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of objects appropriately to free up memory in .NET applications.

Following best practices ensures your application remains efficient and responsive.
