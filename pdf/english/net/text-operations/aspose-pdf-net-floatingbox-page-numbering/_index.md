dotnet add package Aspose.PDF
```

```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**

### License Acquisition

To use Aspose.PDF, you can start with a free trial. For extended usage, consider obtaining a temporary license or purchasing a subscription:

- **Free Trial:** Access basic features without limitations on functionality.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for full-feature access from [Aspose's website](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

### Basic Initialization

After installation, initialize your project with Aspose.PDF as follows:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll implement page numbering using the FloatingBox feature.

### Adding a FloatingBox for Page Numbering

A `FloatingBox` allows you to place content at specific positions in your PDF pages. Here's how you can use it to add page numbers:

#### Step 1: Instantiate Document and Add Pages
Firstly, create a new document and add a page where the floating box will be placed.

```csharp
// Create a new PDF document
Document document = new Document();

// Add a Page to the pdf document
Page page = document.Pages.Add();
```

#### Step 2: Initialize FloatingBox

Create an instance of `FloatingBox` with desired dimensions and position it appropriately on your page.

```csharp
// Initialize a FloatingBox with width and height
FloatingBox box1 = new FloatingBox(140, 80);

// Set the left and top positions for precise placement
box1.Left = 2;
box1.Top = 10;

// Add page numbering text to the FloatingBox paragraphs
box1.Paragraphs.Add(new Text.TextFragment("Page: ($p/ $P )"));

// Add the floating box to the current page
page.Paragraphs.Add(box1);
```

**Explanation:**  
- `FloatingBox(140, 80)`: Defines the size of the box.
- `$p` and `$P`: Placeholders for current and total pages.

#### Step 3: Save the Document

Finally, save your document to a specified location.

```csharp
// Define output path
string outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/PageNumberinHeaderFooterUsingFloatingBox_out.pdf";

// Save the document
document.Save(outputPath);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Verify that the license is set up if using advanced features beyond the free trial.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where this feature can be beneficial:

1. **Legal Documents:** For numbering pages in contracts and agreements to ensure clarity and reference points.
2. **Reports:** Enhance readability by adding page numbers for easy navigation in lengthy reports.
3. **Academic Papers:** Ensure each submission follows a standardized format with numbered pages.

- **Optimize File Size:** Use compression options to reduce PDF file size if needed.
- **Efficient Memory Usage:** Dispose of objects properly after use to manage memory effectively.
- **Batch Processing:** For multiple documents, consider parallel processing to improve performance.
