- Apply for a **temporary license** if needed (https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/)
- Purchase a full license for commercial use (https://purchase.aspose.com/buy)
### Basic Initialization
Initialize your document object:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
// Initialize a new Document instance
document doc = new Document("input.pdf");
```
## Implementation Guide
Let’s explore two main features: removing unused fonts and replacing them with Arial Bold.
### Feature 1: Remove Unused Fonts
#### Overview
Focuses on cleaning up your PDF by eliminating any fonts that aren't used, reducing file size and improving load times.
#### Steps to Implement
**Step 1:** Load the Source PDF Document
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/ReplaceTextPage.pdf";
document doc = new Document(dataDir);
```
Specify the path to your source PDF document. Ensure `dataDir` points correctly.
**Step 2:** Create a TextFragmentAbsorber with Font Removal Options
```csharp
TextFragmentAbsorber absorber = new TextFragmentAbsorber(new TextEditOptions(TextEditOptions.FontReplace.RemoveUnusedFonts));
```
The `TextFragmentAbsorber` identifies and marks unused fonts for removal.
**Step 3:** Accept the Absorber for All Pages
```csharp
doc.Pages.Accept(absorber);
```
This step processes every page in your document, ensuring comprehensive font optimization.
**Step 4:** Replace Fonts with Arial Bold
```csharp
foreach (TextFragment textFragment in absorber.TextFragments)
{
    textFragment.TextState.Font = FontRepository.FindFont("Arial, Bold");
}
```
After identifying unused fonts, replace them with Arial Bold to maintain consistency and a professional appearance.
**Step 5:** Save the Updated Document
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/RemoveUnusedFonts_out.pdf";
doc.Save(outputDir);
```
Save your optimized document at the desired location using `outputDir`.
### Feature 2: Load and Save PDF Document
#### Overview
Demonstrates how to load a PDF from one location and save it to another, facilitating easy modification and distribution.
#### Steps to Implement
**Step 1:** Define Input and Output Paths
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Input.pdf";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/Output.pdf";
```
Set your input and output directories accordingly.
**Step 2:** Load the Document
```csharp
document doc = new Document(dataDir);
```
Load your PDF file using its path.
**Step 3:** Save the Document
```csharp
doc.Save(outputDir);
```
Save the document to a new location or with any modifications applied.
## Practical Applications
1. **Automated Report Generation:** Optimize fonts in batch-processed reports for consistent branding and efficient storage.
2. **E-commerce Product Catalogs:** Use optimized PDFs for product listings, reducing load times on mobile devices.
3. **Document Archiving:** Streamline archives by removing unnecessary data without compromising readability or quality.
4. **Email Attachments:** Optimize PDFs sent as email attachments to improve delivery speeds and reduce storage costs.
5. **Multilingual Documentation:** Efficiently manage fonts when dealing with multiple languages in a single document.
## Performance Considerations
