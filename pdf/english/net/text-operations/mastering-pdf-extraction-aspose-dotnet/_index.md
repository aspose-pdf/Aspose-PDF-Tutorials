```

## Implementation Guide

This section will guide you through extracting text and images from PDF files using different features of Aspose.PDF for .NET.

### Extracting Text from a PDF

#### Overview

Extracting text is crucial for data analysis, reporting, or integrating content into other applications. Here’s how to extract text efficiently:

1. **Full Document Extraction**
2. **Individual Page Extraction**

#### Full Document Extraction

To extract text from an entire document, use the `PdfExtractor` class.

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

namespace PdfTextExtraction
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
            PdfExtractor extractor = new PdfExtractor();
            extractor.Password = ""; // Set if document is password-protected
            extractor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/inFile.pdf");
            extractor.ExtractText();

            // Save extracted text to a file
            extractor.GetText(dataDir + "/extracted_text.txt");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `BindPdf`: Attaches the PDF for extraction.
- `ExtractText`: Initiates the text extraction process.
- `GetText`: Saves the extracted content to a specified file.

#### Individual Page Extraction

For extracting text from specific pages, iterate through each page:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;

namespace PdfPageTextExtraction
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
            PdfExtractor extractor = new PdfExtractor();
            extractor.Password = "";
            extractor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/inFile.pdf");

            while (extractor.HasNextPageText())
            {
                string fileName = $"{dataDir}/{DateTime.Now.Ticks}_out.txt";
                extractor.GetNextPageText(fileName);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `HasNextPageText`: Checks if there are more pages to extract.
- `GetNextPageText`: Extracts text from the next page and saves it.

### Extracting Images from a PDF

#### Overview

Extracting images can be essential for content repurposing or analysis. Here's how you can achieve this using Aspose.PDF:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;
using System.Drawing.Imaging;

namespace PdfImageExtraction
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
            PdfExtractor extractor = new PdfExtractor();
            extractor.Password = "";
            extractor.BindPdf(dataDir + "/inFile.pdf");
            extractor.ExtractImage();

            while (extractor.HasNextImage())
            {
                string fileName = $"{dataDir}/{DateTime.Now.Ticks}_out.jpg";
                extractor.GetNextImage(fileName, ImageFormat.Jpeg);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `ExtractImage`: Extracts all images from the PDF.
- `HasNextImage` and `GetNextImage`: Iterates through each image for extraction.

### Practical Applications

Aspose.PDF's text and image extraction features can be applied in various real-world scenarios:

1. **Data Analysis**: Extracting data for statistical analysis or machine learning models.
2. **Digital Asset Management**: Converting PDF assets into reusable formats for marketing materials.
3. **Content Repurposing**: Using extracted content to populate databases, websites, or apps.

### Performance Considerations

For optimal performance when using Aspose.PDF:

- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of objects after use.
- Use streams for handling large documents instead of loading entire files into memory.
- Optimize PDFs before processing to reduce load times and resource usage.
