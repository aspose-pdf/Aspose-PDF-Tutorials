## Implementation Guide

### Configuring Line Spacing with Text Formatting Options

Firstly, let's understand how to configure line spacing using `TextFormattingOptions`. This feature allows you to control the vertical distance between lines of text for a more refined look.

#### Step 1: Define Your Document and Set Up Formatting Options

Here’s how to create a new document and set up formatting options with full-size line spacing:
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;

public class SpecifyLineSpacing
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        string dataDir = "Path_to_your_directory";
        string fontFile = dataDir + "HPSimplified.TTF";

        Document doc = new Document();
        TextFormattingOptions formattingOptions = new TextFormattingOptions
        {
            LineSpacing = TextFormattingOptions.LineSpacingMode.FullSize
        };
```

#### Step 2: Load the TrueType Font

Next, load your custom font from a file. This is crucial for maintaining the intended appearance of your text.
```csharp
if (fontFile != "")
{
    using (FileStream fontStream = File.OpenRead(fontFile))
    {
        TextFragment textFragment = new TextFragment("Hello world");
        textFragment.TextState.Font = FontRepository.OpenFont(fontStream, FontTypes.TTF);
```

#### Step 3: Position Your Text and Add to the Document

Set up your text fragment's position within the document. This step ensures that the text appears exactly where you want it.
```csharp
textFragment.Position = new Position(100, 600);
        textFragment.TextState.FormattingOptions = formattingOptions;

        var page = doc.Pages.Add();
        page.Paragraphs.Add(textFragment);

        dataDir += "SpecifyLineSpacing_out.pdf";
        doc.Save(dataDir);
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Font File Path:** Ensure the font file path is correct to avoid loading errors.
- **File Stream Management:** Always use a `using` statement for file streams to properly release resources.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where controlling line spacing in PDFs can be particularly useful:
1. **Legal Documents:** Ensuring readability and professional appearance.
2. **Publishing E-books:** Providing consistent formatting across different devices.
3. **Marketing Brochures:** Enhancing visual appeal with custom fonts.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large documents or numerous text manipulations, keep these performance tips in mind:
- Use `using` statements to manage resources efficiently and avoid memory leaks.
- Optimize font loading by caching frequently used TrueType fonts.
