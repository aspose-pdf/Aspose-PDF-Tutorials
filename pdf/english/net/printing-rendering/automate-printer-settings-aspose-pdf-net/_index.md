### Configure Printer Settings
#### Overview
Set up configurations such as auto-resizing, auto-rotating pages, and specifying a printer.

#### Steps:
**Step 1: Bind the PDF Document**
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
viewer.BindPdf(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
```
**Step 2: Enable Auto-Resize and Auto-Rotate Options**
```csharp
viewer.AutoResize = true; // Automatically resize to fit paper size.
viewer.AutoRotate = true; // Rotate pages as necessary.
viewer.PrintPageDialog = false; // Disable print page dialog.
```
**Step 3: Specify Printer and Page Settings**
```csharp
System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings ps = new System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings();
System.Drawing.Printing.PageSettings pgs = new System.Drawing.Printing.PageSettings();

ps.PrinterName = "Microsoft XPS Document Writer";
pgs.PaperSize = new System.Drawing.Printing.PaperSize("A4", 827, 1169);
pgs.Margins = new System.Drawing.Printing.Margins(0, 0, 0, 0);

viewer.PrintDocumentWithSettings(pgs, ps);
```
### Hide Print Dialog and Save as XPS
#### Overview
Disable the print dialog and save documents directly as XPS files.
**Step 1: Configure Printer Settings for File Output**
```csharp
PrinterSettings printerSettings = new PrinterSettings();
printerSettings.PrinterName = "Microsoft XPS Document Writer";
printerSettings.PrintFileName = dataDir + "/print_out.xps";
printerSettings.PrintToFile = true;
```
**Step 2: Disable Print Page Dialog**
```csharp
pdfViewer.PrintPageDialog = false;
```
**Step 3: Execute Printing to File**
