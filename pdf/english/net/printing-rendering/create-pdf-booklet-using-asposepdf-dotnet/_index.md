## Implementation Guide

Creating a booklet with Aspose.PDF .NET involves using the `PdfFileEditor` class. Here's how you can do it step-by-step.

### Initializing PdfFileEditor for Booklet Creation

**Overview:** The `PdfFileEditor` class offers methods to manipulate PDF files, including creating booklets by rearranging pages into a specific format.

#### Step 1: Initialize the PdfFileEditor Object
```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;
// Create an instance of PdfFileEditor.
PdfFileEditor pdfEditor = new PdfFileEditor();
```
**Explanation:** This object will be used to apply booklet transformations on your PDF file.

#### Step 2: Specify Input and Output File Paths
```csharp
string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.pdf"; // Your source PDF file path
string outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/MakeBookletUsingPageSizeAndPaths_out.pdf"; // Desired output PDF file path
```
**Explanation:** Define where your original PDF is located and where you want the booklet to be saved.

#### Step 3: Create a Booklet with Specified Page Size
```csharp
// Create a booklet with A5 page size.
pdfEditor.MakeBooklet(inputFilePath, outputFilePath, PageSize.A5);
```
**Explanation:** The `MakeBooklet` method rearranges pages to fit into an A5 format, ideal for compact reading.

### Troubleshooting Tips
