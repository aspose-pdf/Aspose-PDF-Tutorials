## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll walk through adding text stamps using Aspose.PDF Java.

### Adding Text Stamp to PDF

This feature allows you to annotate every page of your PDF document with a custom stamp.

#### 1. Open the PDF Document

Load your PDF document into an instance of `Document`.

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
// Load the PDF file from a specified path
document = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.pdf");
```
*Why?* Opening the document is essential to access its pages and apply modifications.

#### 2. Create and Configure Text Stamp

Create a `TextStamp` object with your desired text content.

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.TextStamp;
import com.aspose.pdf.Color;
import com.aspose.pdf.FontRepository;
import com.aspose.pdf.HorizontalAlignment;
import com.aspose.pdf.VerticalAlignment;

// Create a new TextStamp
textStamp = new TextStamp("Sample Stamp");

// Set stamp properties for positioning and styling
textStamp.setTopMargin(10);
textStamp.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center);
textStamp.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Top);

// Configure the text appearance of the stamp
textStamp.getTextState().setFont(FontRepository.findFont("Arial"));
textStamp.getTextState().setFontSize(14.0F);
textStamp.getTextState().setFontStyle(com.aspose.pdf.FontStyles.Bold | com.aspose.pdf.FontStyles.Italic);
textStamp.getTextState().setForegroundColor(Color.getGreen());
```
*Why?* Customizing the stamp ensures it meets your branding or document requirements.

#### 3. Add Stamp to Each Page

Iterate through each page in the PDF and apply the text stamp.

```java
// Iterate over all pages and add the stamp
document.getPages().forEach(page -> page.addStamp(textStamp));
```
*Why?* Applying the stamp to each page ensures consistency across your document.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Fonts:** Ensure that any fonts used are installed on your system or accessible in your project.
- **Memory Issues:** For large documents, consider optimizing memory usage by processing pages sequentially and freeing resources promptly.

## Practical Applications

Text stamps can enhance PDFs for various purposes:
1. **Branding**: Add company logos or footers to every page.
2. **Watermarking**: Protect sensitive documents with a watermark.
3. **Batch Processing**: Automate the process of updating multiple files in bulk.
4. **Document Tracking**: Include timestamps or version numbers on each page for document management.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Resource Usage:** For large-scale PDF processing, manage memory by handling one page at a time and releasing resources after processing.
- **Best Practices:** Regularly update Aspose.PDF to leverage performance improvements in newer versions.
