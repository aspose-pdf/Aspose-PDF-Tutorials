```

### Environment Setup Requirements
- Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of Java programming and familiarity with handling files in Java will be helpful.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java

Aspose.PDF is a powerful library that enables you to create, modify, and convert PDFs. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Add Dependency**: First, integrate the Aspose.PDF library into your project using Maven or Gradle as shown above.
2. **License Acquisition**:
   - You can start with a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).
   - For extensive usage, consider obtaining a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) or purchasing a full license.
3. **Basic Initialization**: 
   ```java
   // Import necessary Aspose libraries
   import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
   ```

With these steps completed, you're ready to add page stamps to your PDF documents.

## Implementation Guide

### Adding Page Stamp to a PDF Document

This feature allows you to overlay a stamp from one PDF onto another. Let’s break it down:

#### Overview
You will take a page from `stamp.pdf` and place it as a background on the first page of `input.pdf`.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Load Your Documents**
Begin by loading both your main document and the stamp source.
```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
Document pdfStampSource = new Document(dataDir + "/stamp.pdf");
```

**2. Create a Stamp Object**
Use the first page of `stamp.pdf` to create your stamp object.
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.PdfPageStamp;

PdfPageStamp pageStamp = new PdfPageStamp(pdfStampSource.getPages().get_Item(1));
pageStamp.setBackground(true); // Stamp in background
// Set position and rotation for precise placement
pageStamp.setXIndent(100);
pageStamp.setYIndent(100);
pageStamp.setRotate(com.aspose.pdf.Rotation.on180);
```

**3. Add the Stamp to Your Document**
Now, apply this stamp to your main document.
```java
pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).addStamp(pageStamp);
// Save the updated document
String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
pdfDocument.save(outputDir + "/output_pdfpagestamp.pdf");
```

### Rotating Page Stamp in a PDF Document
To rotate a stamp, adjust its orientation before adding it to your target PDF.

#### Overview
This process involves setting the rotation on your `PdfPageStamp` object and then applying it to your document.

**1. Load Documents**
Just as before, load both documents.
```java
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
Document pdfStampSource = new Document(dataDir + "/stamp.pdf");
```

**2. Create and Configure the Stamp**
Create a stamp and set its rotation.
```java
PdfPageStamp pageStamp = new PdfPageStamp(pdfStampSource.getPages().get_Item(1));
pageStamp.setRotate(com.aspose.pdf.Rotation.on180);
```

**3. Apply and Save**
Add the rotated stamp to your PDF, then save it.
```java
pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).addStamp(pageStamp);
pdfDocument.save(outputDir + "/output_rotated_stamp.pdf");
```

## Practical Applications
Adding page stamps can be useful in various scenarios:
- **Branding**: Insert company logos or watermarks for branding purposes.
- **Legal Documents**: Add confidentiality notices on sensitive documents.
- **Invoices and Receipts**: Stamp date and approval signatures for verification.

Integration with other systems like automated document workflows or report generation tools is also possible, enhancing document management processes.

## Performance Considerations
When working with PDFs using Aspose.PDF:
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of `Document` objects once operations are complete.
- For large-scale processing, consider batching tasks to optimize performance and resource usage.

## Conclusion
You've now mastered the art of adding page stamps to your PDF documents using Aspose.PDF for Java. This skill is essential for document customization in professional environments. Consider exploring further features offered by Aspose.PDF to enhance your applications even more!

### Next Steps
- Experiment with different stamp placements and rotations.
- Explore other functionalities such as text annotations or form filling.
