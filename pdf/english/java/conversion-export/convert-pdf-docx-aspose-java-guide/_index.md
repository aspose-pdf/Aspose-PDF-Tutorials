### Maven Installation
Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle Installation
Include this in your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-pdf:25.3'
```

class InitializeAsposePDF {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        License license = new License();
        try {
            // Apply license from file or stream
            license.setLicense("path/to/your/license/file");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error setting license: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Explore three main features of converting PDF files to DOC/DOCX formats using Aspose.PDF for Java.

### Saving PDF to DOC Format
#### Overview
This feature demonstrates basic conversion from a PDF file to the Microsoft Word DOC format, ideal for straightforward conversions without complex layout requirements.

#### Steps:
##### Step 1: Load the Source PDF Document
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;

String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/input2.pdf");
```
##### Step 2: Save as DOC File
```java
pdfDocument.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/TableHeightIssue.doc", SaveFormat.Doc);
```

### Saving PDF to DOCX Format
#### Overview
This feature shows how to convert a PDF file into the Microsoft Word DOCX format using `DocSaveOptions` for more control over output settings.

#### Steps:
##### Step 1: Load the Source PDF Document
```java
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
```
##### Step 2: Configure DocSaveOptions
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.DocSaveOptions;

DocSaveOptions saveOptions = new DocSaveOptions();
saveOptions.setFormat(DocSaveOptions.DocFormat.DocX);
```
##### Step 3: Save as DOCX File
```java
doc.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/savingToDOCX.docx", saveOptions);
```

### Using DocSaveOptions for Advanced Conversion Settings
#### Overview
This feature explores advanced settings using `DocSaveOptions` to enhance conversion accuracy, especially useful when preserving complex layouts.

#### Steps:
##### Step 1: Load the Source PDF Document
```java
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "/source.pdf");
```
##### Step 2: Set Advanced Save Options
```java
DocSaveOptions saveOption = new DocSaveOptions();
saveOption.setMode(DocSaveOptions.RecognitionMode.Flow);
saveOption.setRelativeHorizontalProximity(2.5f);
saveOption.setRecognizeBullets(true);
```
##### Step 3: Save with Advanced Settings
```java
document.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/usingTheDocSaveOptionsClass.doc", saveOption);
```
