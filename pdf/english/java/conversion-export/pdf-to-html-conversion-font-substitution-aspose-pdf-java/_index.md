- Real-world applications of the conversion process.

Before diving into implementation, ensure you have all necessary prerequisites ready.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial effectively, you'll need:

- **Libraries and Versions**: Ensure you have Aspose.PDF for Java version 25.3.
- **Environment Setup**: A development environment capable of running Java applications (IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse recommended).
- **Knowledge Requirements**: Familiarity with Java programming concepts, especially handling files and exceptions.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java

### Installation via Maven

To add Aspose.PDF to your project using Maven, include the following dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Installation via Gradle

For projects using Gradle, add the following line to your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-pdf:25.3'
```

### License Acquisition Steps

Aspose.PDF offers various licensing options:
- **Free Trial**: Test out features with limitations.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for full access during evaluation.
- **Purchase**: Buy a subscription or perpetual license for long-term use.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once you've added the library, initialize it in your Java application:

```java
com.aspose.pdf.License license = new com.aspose.pdf.License();
license.setLicense("path_to_your_license.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature Overview: PDF to HTML Conversion with Font Substitution

This feature allows you to convert PDF documents into HTML format while substituting unavailable fonts with specified alternatives, ensuring visual consistency.

#### Step 1: Set Up Directories and Load the Document

Begin by specifying paths for your input PDF and output HTML file:

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input1.pdf"; // Input PDF path
String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/pdfToHTMLWithFontSubstitution.html"; // Output HTML path

// Load the document from the specified directory
Document pdf = new Document(dataDir);
```

#### Step 2: Configure Font Substitution Logic

Create a custom subclass of `CustomFontSubstitutionBase` to handle font substitutions:

```java
CustomSubst1 subst1 = new CustomSubst1();
FontRepository.getSubstitutions().add(subst1);
```

#### Step 3: Add a Notifier for Font Substitution Events

Register an event handler to log or print details about font substitution:

```java
pdf.FontSubstitution.add(new Document.FontSubstitutionHandler() {
    public void invoke(Font font, Font newFont) {
        System.out.println("Original Font: " + font.getFontName() + ", New Font: " + newFont.getFontName());
    }
});
```

#### Step 4: Convert PDF to HTML

Set up the `HtmlSaveOptions` and save the document as an HTML file:

```java
HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions();
pdf.save(outputDir, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all paths are correctly specified.
- Verify that Aspose.PDF license is set properly if you encounter limitations in features.

## Practical Applications

1. **Document Archiving**: Convert legacy PDF archives to web-friendly HTML formats for better accessibility.
2. **E-commerce Platforms**: Transform product catalogs into HTML for seamless integration with online stores.
3. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Enhance CMS by allowing rich document imports and conversions.
4. **Automated Report Generation**: Dynamically convert reports from various departments into HTML for uniform distribution.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing Performance
- Utilize efficient resource management practices to handle large PDFs.
- Ensure the application has sufficient memory allocation to process complex documents smoothly.

### Best Practices for Java Memory Management
- Regularly monitor and manage JVM heap space.
- Optimize garbage collection by tuning JVM parameters as needed.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you now possess a robust method to convert PDF files into HTML while ensuring font consistency. This skill is invaluable in maintaining document integrity across platforms.
