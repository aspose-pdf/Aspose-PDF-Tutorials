# How to Convert PDF to HTML in Java Using Aspose.PDF: Exclude Specific Fonts

## Introduction

Converting PDFs to HTML while controlling font usage can be challenging. This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Aspose.PDF library for Java to achieve this, ensuring your documents look consistent on web platforms.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to exclude specific fonts during PDF to HTML conversion using Aspose.PDF for Java.
- Techniques to fine-tune the output with additional configuration options.
- Best practices and real-world applications for performance optimization.

Let's begin by setting up your development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies

You need Aspose.PDF for Java version 25.3 or later.

### Environment Setup Requirements

- A compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for development and testing.

### Knowledge Prerequisites

Basic familiarity with Java programming and file handling will be beneficial.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java

To use Aspose.PDF for Java, include it in your project via Maven or Gradle:

**Maven:**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**

```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-pdf:25.3'
```

### License Acquisition

Aspose.PDF for Java requires a license. You can start with a free trial or request a temporary license for extensive testing.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup

After adding Aspose.PDF to your project, initialize it as follows:

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
```

Ensure you set up your directory paths for input PDFs and output HTML files.

## Implementation Guide

Our guide includes basic font exclusion and advanced configuration options.

### Feature 1: Basic Font Exclusion in PDF to HTML Conversion

This feature allows converting a PDF document to HTML while excluding specific fonts, ensuring web pages look consistent without unnecessary font resources.

#### Overview

Aspose.PDF replicates the original PDF's styling by default. You can exclude certain fonts for better control over your output.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Set Up File Paths**

Define directories and file paths:

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

**Step 2: Initialize `HtmlSaveOptions` with Font Exclusion Settings**

Configure the HTML save options:

```java
HtmlSaveOptions htmlOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions();
htmlOptions.setExcludeFontNameList(new String[]{"Arial", "Calibri"});
htmlOptions.setDefaultFontName("Arial Black");
```

**Step 3: Load and Save the PDF Document**

Load your PDF document and apply save options:

```java
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/ExcludeFont.pdf");
pdfDocument.save(outputDir + "/ExcludeFontResources.html", htmlOptions);
```

### Feature 2: Advanced Configuration for Font Exclusion

Enhance control over the HTML output with additional configuration options.

#### Overview

Advanced settings allow granular adjustments, including layout consistency and image handling. Here's how to use these features:

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Set Up Additional `HtmlSaveOptions`**

Configure save options with extra parameters:

```java
HtmlSaveOptions htmlOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions();
htmlOptions.setExplicitListOfSavedPages(new int[]{1});
htmlOptions.setFixedLayout(true);
htmlOptions.setCompressSvgGraphicsIfAny(false);
htmlOptions.setSaveTransparentTexts(true);
htmlOptions.setSaveShadowedTextsAsTransparentTexts(true);

htmlOptions.setExcludeFontNameList(new String[]{"ArialMT", "SymbolMT"});
htmlOptions.setDefaultFontName("Comic Sans MS");

htmlOptions.setUseZOrder(true);
htmlOptions.setLettersPositioningMethod(LettersPositioningMethods.UseEmUnitsAndCompensationOfRoundingErrorsInCss);
htmlOptions.setPartsEmbeddingMode(HtmlSaveOptions.PartsEmbeddingModes.NoEmbedding);

htmlOptions.setRasterImagesSavingMode(HtmlSaveOptions.RasterImagesSavingModes.AsEmbeddedPartsOfPngPageBackground);
htmlOptions.setSplitIntoPages(false);
```

**Step 2: Load and Save with Advanced Options**

```java
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/ExcludeFontResourcesWithAdditionalOptions.pdf");
pdfDocument.save(outputDir + "/ExcludeFontResourcesWithAdditionalOptions.html", htmlOptions);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Fonts Not Excluded**: Ensure font names match exactly, as they appear in the PDF.
- **Layout Issues**: Check `HtmlSaveOptions` settings for layout properties like `setFixedLayout`.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory usage and adjust JVM settings if necessary for large documents.

## Practical Applications

Consider these real-world scenarios:
1. **Web Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Convert uploaded PDFs to HTML while maintaining brand consistency by excluding unnecessary fonts.
2. **E-commerce Platforms**: Display product descriptions from PDFs on websites without relying on unavailable or non-licensed fonts.
3. **Digital Libraries**: Convert archival documents into HTML for easier online access, using a default font for readability across devices and browsers.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when using Aspose.PDF:
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: For large-scale conversions, process in batches or use streaming if supported by the library.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Monitor resource usage to avoid memory leaks. Use Java's garbage collection options as needed.

## Conclusion

This tutorial explored converting PDFs to HTML with Aspose.PDF for Java while excluding specific fonts. We covered basic and advanced configuration options to give you complete control over the output format.
