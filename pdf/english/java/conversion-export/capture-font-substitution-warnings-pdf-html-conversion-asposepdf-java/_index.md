# How to Capture Font Substitution Warnings in PDF to HTML Conversion Using Aspose.PDF Java

## Introduction

Converting PDFs into HTML format can often lead to font substitutions, impacting layout and visual integrity. With **Aspose.PDF for Java**, capturing these font substitution warnings becomes straightforward, helping ensure your conversions are accurate and maintain their intended appearance.

This tutorial will guide you through implementing font substitution warnings when converting PDF documents to HTML using Aspose.PDF for Java. You'll gain insights into the technical steps and understand why certain configurations are crucial.

**What You'll Learn:**
- The importance of capturing font substitutions during conversion.
- How to set up a font substitution handler in your application.
- Key configuration options for optimizing PDF to HTML conversions.

Let's begin by checking out the prerequisites needed before we get started.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
To use Aspose.PDF for Java, include it as a dependency in your project. Follow these installation instructions using Maven or Gradle:

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-pdf:25.3'
```

### Environment Setup Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing and testing your code.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Familiarity with Maven/Gradle build tools, if applicable.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java

To start using Aspose.PDF for Java, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Include the Aspose.PDF library in your project as shown above.
2. **License Acquisition**:
   - Obtain a free trial license to explore full features without limitations [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
   - For extended use, consider purchasing a subscription or acquiring a temporary license from [Aspose](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Basic Initialization**: Create an instance of the `Document` class and load your PDF file as demonstrated below:

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Document pdfDoc = new Document(dataDir + "input1.pdf");
```

Now, let's proceed with our implementation guide.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Font Substitution Warning in PDF to HTML Conversion

This feature allows you to monitor and capture any font substitutions that occur during the conversion process from PDF to HTML format.

#### Step 1: Load Your PDF Document
Load your existing PDF file using Aspose.PDF's `Document` class. This step is essential for accessing its content and applying further operations.

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Document pdfDoc = new Document(dataDir + "input1.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Set Up a Font Substitution Handler
Implement a font substitution handler to capture any changes in fonts during conversion. This handler logs the original and substituted fonts.

```java
final Map<String, String> names = new HashMap<>();
pdfDoc.FontSubstitution.add(new Document.FontSubstitutionHandler() {
    public void invoke(Font font, Font newFont) {
        // Log substituted FontNames into a map.
        names.put(font.getFontName(), newFont.getFontName());
    }
});
```

**Why This Step?**
Capturing font substitutions enables you to take corrective actions if the visual integrity of your document is compromised.

#### Step 3: Configure HTML Save Options
Set up `HtmlSaveOptions` to define how the PDF should be saved as an HTML file. 

```java
HtmlSaveOptions htmlSaveOps = new HtmlSaveOptions();
```

**Key Configuration Options:**
- Adjust settings like image compression, font embedding, and more through properties of `HtmlSaveOptions`.

#### Step 4: Save the Converted Document
Finally, save your PDF document as an HTML file using the specified options.

```java
pdfDoc.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/getWarningForFontSubstitution.html\
