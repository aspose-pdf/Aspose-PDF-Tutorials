## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed on your system.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing and running Java code.
- A basic understanding of Java programming concepts.

Next, we'll guide you through setting up Aspose.PDF for Java in your project.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java

Aspose.PDF is a versatile library that enables developers to create, modify, and extract information from PDF files. Here’s how to add it to your Java project:

### Maven
Include the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
Add this line to your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-pdf:25.3'
```

#### License Acquisition
To use Aspose.PDF without limitations, consider obtaining a license. You can start with a free trial or request a temporary license if you need more time for evaluation. For long-term usage, purchase a subscription from the [Aspose website](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

Once your environment is ready, let's dive into extracting PDF page properties.

## Implementation Guide

### Extracting Page Properties

In this section, we'll explore how to extract various properties of a PDF page using Aspose.PDF for Java. We’ll break down the process step-by-step:

#### Step 1: Open a Document
Begin by loading your PDF document into an `Aspose.Pdf.Document` object.
```java
Document pdfDocument = new Document("input.pdf");
```
This step initializes the document you want to work with, allowing access to its contents.

#### Step 2: Access Page Collection
Retrieve the collection of pages in the document using:
```java
PageCollection pageCollection = pdfDocument.getPages();
```
The `PageCollection` object holds all the pages within your PDF file.

#### Step 3: Get a Specific Page
Select a specific page from the collection. For instance, to get the first page:
```java
Page pdfPage = pageCollection.get_Item(1);
```

#### Step 4: Extract Properties
Now, extract various box properties and other attributes of the selected page.

- **ArtBox:** Defines the intended printing area.
  ```java
  System.out.printf("\n ArtBox : Height = " + pdfPage.getArtBox().getHeight() +
                    ", Width = " + pdfPage.getArtBox().getWidth() +
                    ", LLX = " + pdfPage.getArtBox().getLLX() +
                    ", LLY = " + pdfPage.getArtBox().getLLY() +
                    ", URX = " + pdfPage.getArtBox().getURX() +
                    ", URY = " + pdfPage.getArtBox().getURY());
  ```

- **BleedBox:** Specifies the area to include bleed during printing.
  ```java
  System.out.printf("\n BleedBox : Height = " + pdfPage.getBleedBox().getHeight() +
                    ", Width = " + pdfPage.getBleedBox().getWidth() +
                    ", LLX = " + pdfPage.getBleedBox().getLLX() +
                    ", LLY = " + pdfPage.getBleedBox().getLLY() +
                    ", URX = " + pdfPage.getBleedBox().getURX() +
                    ", URY = " + pdfPage.getBleedBox().getURY());
  ```

- **CropBox, MediaBox, TrimBox, and Rect:** These boxes define different areas related to cropping, media size, trimming, and overall dimensions.

Continue extracting other properties like page number and rotation:
```java
System.out.printf("\n Page Number :- " + pdfPage.getNumber());
System.out.printf("\n Rotate :-" + pdfPage.getRotate());
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your PDF file path is correct.
- Verify that Aspose.PDF library is correctly added to your project dependencies.

## Practical Applications

Extracting page properties can be useful in various scenarios:

1. **PDF Analysis:** Understanding the structure and layout of a PDF for content analysis.
2. **Document Processing:** Automating tasks like cropping or resizing based on box dimensions.
3. **Printing Services:** Adjusting print settings according to media size or bleed requirements.

Integration with other systems can include exporting these properties to databases or using them in reporting tools.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large PDF files, consider:
- Efficiently managing memory by releasing resources after processing.
- Using Aspose.PDF's built-in methods for optimal performance.
- Adjusting JVM settings to handle large applications effectively.

Adhering to these best practices ensures smooth operation and resource management.
