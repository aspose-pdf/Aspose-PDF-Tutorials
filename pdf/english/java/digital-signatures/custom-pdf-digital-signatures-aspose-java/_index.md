## Implementation Guide

### Setting Up Signature Custom Appearance

**Overview:** Customize how digital signatures appear within a PDF to meet branding or compliance requirements.

#### Creating a SignatureAppearance Object
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.SignatureCustomAppearance;

// Initialize and configure the custom appearance for your signature
SignatureCustomAppearance signatureCustomAppearance = new SignatureCustomAppearance();
signatureCustomAppearance.setDateSignedAtLabel("Fecha");
signatureCustomAppearance.setDigitalSignedLabel("Digitalmente firmado por");
signatureCustomAppearance.setReasonLabel("Razón");
signatureCustomAppearance.setLocationLabel("Localización");
signatureCustomAppearance.setFontFamilyName("Arial");
signatureCustomAppearance.setFontSize(10d);
signatureCustomAppearance.setDateTimeFormat("yyyy.MM.dd HH:mm:ss");
```
- **Parameters Explained**: Customize labels, font settings, and date formats to fit your needs.
  
### Creating and Configuring PKCS7 Signature Object

**Overview:** Set up a PKCS7 signature object with the custom appearance configured earlier.

#### Configuring PKCS7 for Digital Signatures
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.PKCS7;

PKCS7 pkcs = new PKCS7("path/to/your/certificate.pfx\
