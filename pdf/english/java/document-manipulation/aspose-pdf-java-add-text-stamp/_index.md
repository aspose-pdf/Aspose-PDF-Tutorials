# How to Add a Text Stamp to PDF Using Aspose.PDF for Java

## Introduction
In today's digital age, managing and modifying documents efficiently is crucial in both personal and professional settings. Adding a text stamp to a PDF can help identify document versions, add watermarks, or provide necessary annotations without altering the original content. This comprehensive guide will walk you through using Aspose.PDF for Java to seamlessly integrate text stamps into your PDFs.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to add a text stamp to a specific page in a PDF
- Steps to apply a text stamp across all pages of a document
- Key configurations and font customizations for your text stamp

With these skills, you can enhance your documents efficiently and professionally. Let's start by looking at the prerequisites needed before we begin.

## Prerequisites
Before starting with Aspose.PDF for Java, ensure that you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
You'll need to include the Aspose.PDF library in your project. This can be easily accomplished using Maven or Gradle build tools.

### Environment Setup Requirements
Ensure you have a compatible version of Java installed (Java 8+ recommended). Your development environment should also support these build tools for dependency management.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of Java programming and familiarity with handling dependencies in your project is beneficial. No prior experience with Aspose.PDF is necessary, as we will cover the basics here.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java
To begin using Aspose.PDF for Java, you need to include it in your project dependencies. Here’s how to set it up:

### Maven Setup
Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle Setup
Include this in your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-pdf:25.3'
```

### License Acquisition
To use Aspose.PDF for Java, you can start with a free trial to evaluate the library’s capabilities. For extended features and support, consider purchasing a license or obtaining a temporary license. Detailed instructions are available on their official site.

Once your environment is set up, initialize the library as shown below:
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;

// Initialize Aspose.PDF Document object
Document pdfDocument = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide
We'll break down the process into two main features: adding a text stamp to a specific page and applying it across all pages.

### Feature 1: Adding Text Stamp in PDF (Page-Specific)
**Overview:** This feature demonstrates how to add a text stamp to a particular page of your PDF document, allowing for targeted annotations or watermarks.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### Import Necessary Libraries
Start by importing the required Aspose.PDF classes:
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Color;
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
import com.aspose.pdf.FontRepository;
import com.aspose.pdf.FontStyles;
import com.aspose.pdf.Rotation;
import com.aspose.pdf.TextStamp;
```
##### Open a PDF Document
Load your document using the `Document` class:
```java
Document pdfDocument = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.pdf");
```
##### Create and Configure Text Stamp
Create a new `TextStamp` instance with custom text and configure its properties:
```java
TextStamp textStamp = new TextStamp("Sample Stamp");

// Set background to true if the stamp should be behind other content
textStamp.setBackground(true);

// Specify position of the stamp on the page (in points)
textStamp.setXIndent(100);
textStamp.setYIndent(100);

// Rotate the stamp 90 degrees
textStamp.setRotate(Rotation.on90);

// Configure font properties for visibility and style
textStamp.getTextState().setFont(new FontRepository().findFont("Arial"));
textStamp.getTextState().setFontSize(14.0F);
textStamp.getTextState().setFontStyle(FontStyles.Bold | FontStyles.Italic);
textStamp.getTextState().setForegroundColor(Color.getGreen());
```
##### Add Stamp to Specific Page
Select the page and add your configured stamp:
```java
pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).addStamp(textStamp);
```
##### Save the Modified Document
Finally, save your changes back to a new file:
```java
pdfDocument.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/TextStamp_output.pdf");
```

### Feature 2: Adding Text Stamp to All Pages in PDF
**Overview:** This feature is useful for applying uniform annotations or watermarks across all pages of the document.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### Iterate Through Each Page
Use a loop to apply your text stamp to every page:
```java
for (int Page_counter = 1; Page_counter <= pdfDocument.getPages().size(); Page_counter++) {
    // Add the stamp to each page of the PDF file.
    pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(Page_counter).addStamp(textStamp);
}
```
##### Save Changes
As before, save your document with all modifications:
```java
pdfDocument.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/TextStamp_All_Pages_output.pdf");
```

## Practical Applications
1. **Version Control:** Use text stamps to indicate document versions or revisions across company reports.
2. **Watermarking:** Apply watermarks to protect sensitive information from unauthorized distribution.
3. **Batch Processing:** Automate stamping in large batches of documents, such as invoices or forms.

These applications demonstrate the versatility and power of Aspose.PDF for Java in real-world scenarios.

## Performance Considerations
When working with large PDFs or batch processing multiple files, consider these performance tips:
- Optimize memory usage by managing document resources effectively.
- Use efficient loops and minimize redundant operations to speed up processing times.
- Consider asynchronous processing if integrating into a larger system.

Following best practices ensures that your application remains responsive and efficient.

## Conclusion
By now, you should be well-equipped to add text stamps to PDF documents using Aspose.PDF for Java. This functionality can significantly enhance document management workflows by providing clear annotations or branding across multiple pages.

As next steps, consider exploring more advanced features of Aspose.PDF or integrating it into your existing Java applications. Try implementing these techniques and see how they improve your document processing tasks.
