To initialize Aspose.PDF, simply import the necessary classes and create an instance of `Document` to start working with PDFs.
## Implementation Guide
Now let's break down the steps needed to add an HTML ordered list into your PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java.
### Creating a New PDF Document
Firstly, instantiate a new `Document` object as the base of our PDF file:
```java
// Instantiate Document object to create a new PDF document
doc = new Document();
```
### Adding an HTML Fragment
Use the `HtmlFragment` class to interpret and render HTML within the PDF.
#### Step 1: Create an HtmlFragment
Create an `HtmlFragment` with your desired HTML content:
```java
// Create an HtmlFragment with the HTML content for the ordered list
t = new HtmlFragment("<body style='line-height: 100px;'><ul><li>First</li><li>Second</li><li>Third</li><li>Fourth</li><li>Fifth</li></ul>Text after the list.<br/>Next line<br/>Last line</body>");
```
#### Step 2: Add a New Page to the Document
Add a new page to your document:
```java
// Add a new page to the PDF document
page = doc.getPages().add();
```
#### Step 3: Insert the HtmlFragment into the Page
Add your `HtmlFragment` to the newly created page:
```java
// Insert the HtmlFragment into the newly added page
page.getParagraphs().add(t);
```
### Saving the PDF Document
Save the document to a specified directory:
```java
// Save the created PDF document
doc.save(outputDir + "/AddHTMLOrderedListIntoDocuments_out.pdf");
```
## Practical Applications
- **Report Generation**: Automatically populate reports with dynamic data organized in lists.
- **Invoice Creation**: Use ordered lists for itemized billing details.
- **Documentation**: Enhance user manuals or technical documents with structured content.
## Performance Considerations
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of unused objects.
- Optimize HTML content to minimize parsing time.
- Use Java’s garbage collection features effectively when handling large PDFs.
