### Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have:
- The Aspose.PDF for Java library (installation covered with Maven or Gradle).
- A basic understanding of Java programming.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse set up on your machine.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java
To start using Aspose.PDF for Java, include the library in your project:

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Here's how to initialize your first PDF document with Aspose.PDF for Java:
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;

class PdfSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize a new Document instance
        Document doc = new Document();
        System.out.println("PDF document initialized successfully.");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
We’ll break down the process of creating and customizing tables into distinct sections for clarity.

### Feature 1: Creating and Adding a Table to a Document
**Overview:**
Adding a table is straightforward. We'll create a new PDF, add a page, instantiate a table, and append it to our document.

**Steps:**
#### Step 1: Create a New PDF Document
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
import com.aspose.pdf.Table;

class CreateTable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize a new Document instance
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
        String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

        Document doc = new Document();
        
        // Add a page to the document
        doc.getPages().add();

        // Instantiate and add a Table object to the first page's paragraphs
        Table table = new Table();
        doc.getPages().get_Item(1).getParagraphs().add(table);

        // Save your document with the newly added table
        String outputFilePath = dataDir + "/TableCreationOutput.pdf";
        doc.save(outputFilePath);
    }
}
```

### Feature 2: Setting Table Column Widths and Default Cell Borders
**Overview:**
Customizing column widths and default cell borders ensures that tables look professional and are easy to read.

#### Step 1: Define Column Widths
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.BorderInfo;
import com.aspose.pdf.BorderSide;

// Set the desired column widths for your table
String[] columnWidths = {"50", "50", "50"};
table.setColumnWidths(String.join(" ", columnWidths));
```

#### Step 2: Configure Default Cell Borders
```java
// Create a BorderInfo object to set default cell border properties
BorderInfo defaultCellBorder = new BorderInfo(BorderSide.All, 0.1F);
table.setDefaultCellBorder(defaultCellBorder);
```

### Feature 3: Customizing Table Borders and Padding
**Overview:**
Adjusting borders and padding can enhance the visual appeal of your tables.

#### Step 1: Set Table Borders
```java
// Create a custom BorderInfo object for table border settings
BorderInfo tableBorder = new BorderInfo(BorderSide.All, 1F);
table.setBorder(tableBorder);
```

#### Step 2: Define Cell Padding
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.MarginInfo;

// Configure padding for cells using MarginInfo
MarginInfo margin = new MarginInfo();
margin.setLeft(5f); // Set left margin
margin.setRight(5f); // Set right margin
margin.setTop(5f);   // Set top margin
margin.setBottom(5f);// Set bottom margin

// Apply this padding to the table's default cell
table.setDefaultCellPadding(margin);
```

### Feature 4: Adding Rows and Cells to a Table
**Overview:**
Populating your table with data is essential for its functionality.

#### Step 1: Add Rows and Populate Cells
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Row;

// Add the first row and cells
Row row1 = table.getRows().add();
row1.getCells().add("col1");
row1.getCells().add("col2");
row1.getCells().add("col3");

// Add a second row with different content
Row row2 = table.getRows().add();
row2.getCells().add("item1");
row2.getCells().add("item2");
row2.getCells().add("item3");
```
