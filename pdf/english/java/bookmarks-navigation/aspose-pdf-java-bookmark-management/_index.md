## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Delete All Bookmarks from PDF
This feature streamlines a document by removing all bookmarks, making it cleaner and more organized.

#### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Load the Document**
   - Open your PDF file using `Document`.
   ```java
   String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.pdf";
   Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir);
   ```
2. **Delete All Bookmarks**
   - Use the `delete()` method on outlines to remove all bookmarks.
   ```java
   pdfDocument.getOutlines().delete();
   ```
3. **Save the Modified Document**
   - Save your changes to a new file.
   ```java
   String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/deleteBookmarksFromPDFDocument.pdf";
   pdfDocument.save(outputDir);
   ```

### Feature: Delete Specific Bookmark from PDF
For finer control, you can target and remove specific bookmarks by their title.

#### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Load the Document**
   - As before, open your source PDF.
   ```java
   String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/source.pdf";
   Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir);
   ```
2. **Delete a Specific Bookmark**
   - Specify the bookmark title to remove it.
   ```java
   pdfDocument.getOutlines().delete("Child Outline");
   ```
3. **Save the Modified Document**
   - Store your changes in an output file.
   ```java
   String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/deleteParticularBookmark.pdf";
   pdfDocument.save(outputDir);
   ```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure correct path and filename syntax to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify you have necessary permissions for reading/writing files.

## Practical Applications
1. **Digital Libraries:** Remove outdated or redundant bookmarks in educational materials.
2. **Corporate Reports:** Streamline documents by removing unnecessary sections.
3. **Personal Documents:** Customize PDFs by keeping only relevant bookmarks.
4. **Integration with Document Management Systems:** Automate bookmark cleanup processes within larger workflows.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Memory Usage:** Monitor and manage memory usage when working with large PDFs to prevent `OutOfMemoryError`.
- **Efficient File Handling:** Always close files properly using try-with-resources or explicit close methods.
- **Benchmarking:** Test your code under different conditions to identify potential bottlenecks.
