# Create Professional PDF Documents with Aspose.PDF for Java

## Introduction

Are you looking to generate high-quality PDF documents programmatically? Whether you're developing an application that demands precise document formatting or automating report generation, setting up pages and lists accurately is crucial. This comprehensive guide will walk you through using **Aspose.PDF for Java** to create a new PDF document with custom page dimensions, margins, and structured content like headings and lists.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped to:
- Set up your project with Aspose.PDF for Java
- Configure document pages and margins
- Add floating boxes and list items
- Use various numbering styles for headings

Let's begin by setting up your environment so you can start crafting professional PDFs like a pro!

### Prerequisites

Before we dive in, ensure you have the following:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Install JDK 8 or later on your system.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Use any IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing and running Java code.
- **Aspose.PDF for Java Library**: This tutorial uses version 25.3 of Aspose.PDF.

Basic knowledge of Java programming is recommended to follow along comfortably.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java

To start using Aspose.PDF, you need to include it in your project's dependencies. Here are two ways to set up the library:

### Maven

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

Include this line in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-pdf:25.3'
```

### License Acquisition

To use Aspose.PDF, you can start with a free trial by downloading the library from their official site. For extended features, consider purchasing a license or applying for a temporary one through Aspose's licensing page.

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process into manageable steps to understand how each feature works and integrates into your PDF document creation workflow.

### Document Setup

**Overview:**
Creating a new PDF document involves setting up the dimensions of pages and configuring margins. This ensures that all content fits perfectly within the layout you desire.

#### Setting Page Dimensions and Margins

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;

String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Specify your directory path here

Document pdfDoc = new Document();
pdfDoc.getPageInfo().setWidth(612.0);  // Set page width (in points)
pdfDoc.getPageInfo().setHeight(792.0); // Set page height (in points)

// Configure margins
class MarginConfig {
    public static void configureMargins(Document pdfDoc) {
        pdfDoc.getPageInfo().getMargin().setLeft(72);
        pdfDoc.getPageInfo().getMargin().setRight(72);
        pdfDoc.getPageInfo().getMargin().setTop(72);
        pdfDoc.getPageInfo().getMargin().setBottom(72);
    }
}

MarginConfig.configureMargins(pdfDoc);
```

- **Why 612x792 Points?** This size corresponds to an 8.5 x 11-inch page, a common standard for documents.
- **Margins:** Margins are set in points (1 point = 1/72 inch), ensuring consistent spacing around the document content.

### Page Setup

**Overview:**
Adding new pages and setting their properties is straightforward with Aspose.PDF. You can configure dimensions and margins just like you did for the initial page setup.

#### Adding a New Page

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Page;

Page pdfPage = pdfDoc.getPages().add();
pdfPage.getPageInfo().setWidth(612.0);
pdfPage.getPageInfo().setHeight(792.0);

// Apply the same margins to this new page
class PageMarginConfig {
    public static void applyMargins(Page page) {
        MarginConfig.configureMargins(page.getDocument());
    }
}

PageMarginConfig.applyMargins(pdfPage);
```

### FloatingBox Setup

**Overview:**
A floating box allows you to create a block of content that can be positioned flexibly within the page.

#### Creating and Configuring a Floating Box

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.FloatingBox;

FloatingBox floatBox = new FloatingBox();
class FloatBoxConfig {
    public static void configureFloatBox(FloatingBox floatBox, Page pdfPage) {
        MarginConfig.configureMargins(floatBox.getDocument());
        pdfPage.getParagraphs().add(floatBox);  // Add to the page's content
    }
}

FloatBoxConfig.configureFloatBox(floatBox, pdfPage);
```

### Heading with Numbering Style

**Overview:**
Creating structured headings with numbering is essential for organizing document content, especially in lists or outlines.

#### Creating a Level-1 Heading

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Heading;
import com.aspose.pdf.NumberingStyle;

Heading heading = new Heading(1);
class HeadingConfig {
    public static void configureLevel1Heading(Heading heading) {
        heading.setInList(true);  // Enable list formatting
        heading.setStartNumber(1); // Start numbering from this value
        heading.setText("List 1");
        heading.setStyle(NumberingStyle.NumeralsRomanLowercase); // Use Roman lowercase numerals
        heading.setAutoSequence(true); // Continue sequence automatically for similar headings
    }
}

HeadingConfig.configureLevel1Heading(heading);
floatBox.getParagraphs().add(heading);
```

#### Creating a Level-2 Sub-heading

```java
Heading heading3 = new Heading(2);
class SubHeadingConfig {
    public static void configureLevel2Subheading(Heading heading) {
        heading.setInList(true);
        heading.setStartNumber(1);
        heading.setText("the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan on account of each allowed");
        heading.setStyle(NumberingStyle.LettersLowercase); // Use lowercase letters for numbering
        heading.setAutoSequence(true);
    }
}

SubHeadingConfig.configureLevel2Subheading(heading3);
floatBox.getParagraphs().add(heading3);
```

### Saving the Document

Finally, save your document:

```java
pdfDoc.save(dataDir + "RomanNumber.pdf"); // Save to specified path
```

## Practical Applications

Aspose.PDF can be used in various scenarios, such as:
- **Automated Report Generation**: Generate financial reports with structured data and custom formatting.
- **Invoice Creation**: Create invoices with dynamic content that adheres to corporate branding guidelines.
- **Document Management Systems**: Incorporate PDF generation into systems for document tracking and archiving.

## Performance Considerations

When dealing with large documents or numerous operations, consider the following:
- Optimize memory usage by managing resources efficiently.
- Use batch processing if generating multiple PDFs simultaneously.
- Profile your application to identify bottlenecks in resource-intensive sections.
