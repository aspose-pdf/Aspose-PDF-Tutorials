        // Set up the license (if available)
        License license = new License();
        try {
            license.setLicense("path_to_your_license.lic");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("License not found or invalid.");
        }
        
        // Load a PDF document
        Document pdfDocument = new Document("Input.pdf");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Replace Text on Specific Pages in an Existing PDF File

This section demonstrates how to replace text on a specified page within your PDF document.

#### Overview

Replacing text on specific pages allows for precise document modifications without affecting other content. This feature is particularly useful when you need to update or correct information on particular sections of your documents.

**Code Implementation:**

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
import com.aspose.pdf.TextFragmentAbsorber;
import com.aspose.pdf.text.TextSegment;
import com.aspose.pdf.facades.PdfContentEditor;

public class ReplaceTextOnSpecificPage {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Input directory
        String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Output directory

        Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/Input.pdf");
        TextFragmentAbsorber textFragmentAbsorber = new TextFragmentAbsorber("Content");
        
        // Accept the absorber for a specific page only
        pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(2).accept(textFragmentAbsorber);
        
        // Get extracted text fragments
        java.util.List<TextFragment> textFragments = textFragmentAbsorber.getTextFragments();
        
        // Loop through the found text fragments and update text
        for (TextFragment textFragment : textFragments) {
            textFragment.setText("World");
            // Update the segment text
            for (TextSegment segment : textFragment.getSegments()) {
                segment.setText("World");
            }
        }
        
        // Save the updated document
        pdfDocument.save(outputDir + "/ReplaceTextOnSpecificPage.pdf");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **`TextFragmentAbsorber`:** Used to find text fragments in the PDF.
- **`accept(TextFragmentAbsorber)`:** Accepts a specific page for text search and replacement.
- **`setText(String newText)`:** Replaces the specified text with new content on the desired page.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- **File Path Errors:** Ensure correct file paths and permissions.
- **Text Not Found:** Verify that the exact phrase exists on the specified page.

## Practical Applications

This feature can be applied in several real-world scenarios, such as:
1. **Legal Documents:** Updating client names or dates without modifying entire documents.
2. **Technical Manuals:** Correcting version numbers or specifications selectively.
3. **Financial Reports:** Adjusting figures or annotations specific to certain sections.

Integration with systems like document management platforms can further enhance productivity by automating bulk text replacements across numerous PDFs.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large documents, consider these optimization tips:
- **Efficient Memory Usage:** Utilize streams for handling large files.
- **Batch Processing:** Process multiple pages in batches to reduce overhead.
- **Garbage Collection:** Monitor and manage Java's garbage collection to prevent memory leaks.

Adhering to best practices ensures smooth operation and optimal performance when using Aspose.PDF with Java.
