### Setting Default Font in a PDF Document

**Overview:** This feature allows you to set a default font for all text within an existing PDF document. It's particularly useful when the original fonts are missing or need standardization across documents.

#### Step 1: Load Your PDF Document
Start by loading your PDF document using Aspose.PDF:
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

Document doc = new Document("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Configure Save Options
Next, initialize the `PdfSaveOptions` and set the desired default font name:
```java
String newName = "Arial";
PdfSaveOptions ops = new PdfSaveOptions();
ops.setDefaultFontName(newName);
```
Here, `"Arial"` is specified as the new default font. You can choose any available font.

#### Step 3: Save Your Modified PDF
Finally, save your document with the updated settings:
```java
doc.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output_out.pdf\
