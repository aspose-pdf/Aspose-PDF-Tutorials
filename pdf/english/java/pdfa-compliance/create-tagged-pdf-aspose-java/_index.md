#### 1. Initialize the Document
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
import com.aspose.pdf.tagged.ITaggedContent;

public class TagPDFSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new PDF Document instance
        Document document = new Document();
        
        // Get the TaggedContent object for working with tagged elements in the document
        ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.getTaggedContent();
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Document Instance**: Initializes a new, blank PDF.
- **TaggedContent Object**: Prepares the document to handle tagged content, crucial for accessibility features.

### Configuring Document Title and Language
**Overview:**
Set essential metadata like title and language to improve your document’s accessibility.

```java
/**
 * Function demonstrating how to configure a document's title and language attributes.
 */
void configureDocumentTitleAndLanguage(ITaggedContent taggedContent) {
    // Set a title for the document
    taggedContent.setTitle("Tagged Pdf Document");
    
    // Define the language used in the document
    taggedContent.setLanguage("en-US");
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **setTitle**: Assigns a meaningful title to your PDF.
- **setLanguage**: Ensures screen readers interpret content correctly, enhancing accessibility.

### Creating and Configuring an Illustration Element

Add visual elements like images with proper tagging for better document structure.

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.tagged.logicalstructure.elements.IllustrationElement;

/**
 * Function demonstrating how to create and configure an illustration element in a tagged PDF.
 */
void createAndConfigureIllustration(ITaggedContent taggedContent) {
    // Create an illustration (figure) element in the document
    IllustrationElement figure1 = taggedContent.createFigureElement();
    
    // Set properties of the figure element
    figure1.setActualText("Figure One");
    figure1.setTitle("Image 1");
    figure1.setTag("Fig1");
    figure1.setImage("image.png");
    
    // Append the figure element to the root element of the tagged content
    taggedContent.getRootElement().appendChild(figure1);
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **IllustrationElement**: Represents a graphical element in the PDF.
- **Properties Setup**: Include descriptive text, title, tag, and image path for accessibility.
