# How to Annotate PDFs in Java with Strike-Out Annotations Using Aspose.PDF

Unlock the full potential of PDF manipulation using Aspose.PDF for Java by learning how to annotate and save PDF files with strike-out annotations. This comprehensive guide will walk you through initializing a document, searching for text fragments, creating annotations, and saving your annotated document.

## Introduction

Navigating the complexities of PDFs can be challenging, whether it's extracting data or modifying content. If you're looking to add visual annotations like strike-outs directly within your Java applications using Aspose.PDF for Java, this guide is perfect. You'll learn how to seamlessly integrate PDF functionality into your projects.

### What You'll Learn
- How to initialize and load a PDF document with Aspose.PDF
- Techniques to search for specific text fragments in a PDF
- Steps to create and configure strike-out annotations
- Methods to save the modified PDF document

Let's dive into the prerequisites you'll need before we begin.

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
To follow this tutorial, ensure you have:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for editing your Java code.

We’ll be using Aspose.PDF for Java version 25.3. You can incorporate it into your project via Maven or Gradle as shown below.

### Environment Setup Requirements
Ensure your environment is set up to handle the dependencies and that you have access to a directory where your input PDF documents are stored, along with an output directory for saving annotated files.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
Familiarity with Java programming and basic understanding of handling PDFs programmatically will be beneficial.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java
Integrating Aspose.PDF into your Java project is straightforward. Here’s how you can add it using Maven or Gradle:

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-pdf:25.3'
```

### License Acquisition
Aspose.PDF is a commercial library, but you can start by obtaining a free trial or a temporary license for evaluation purposes. Visit the [Aspose purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) to explore your options.

## Implementation Guide
We'll break down our implementation into sections based on functionality: document initialization, text fragment search, annotation creation, and saving the document.

### Document Initialization and Loading
#### Overview
First, we need to load a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for Java. This step involves initializing the `Document` class with the path to your PDF.

**Step 1**: Import necessary classes.
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
```

**Step 2**: Define your document directory and initialize the Document object.
```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
```
This code loads a PDF from `dataDir` into a `Document` instance, allowing further operations.

### Text Fragment Absorption
#### Overview
Searching for text within your PDF is essential before creating annotations. We'll use the `TextFragmentAbsorber`.

**Step 1**: Import the class.
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.TextFragmentAbsorber;
```

**Step 2**: Create an instance of TextFragmentAbsorber with the search query.
```java
TextFragmentAbsorber textFragmentAbsorber = new TextFragmentAbsorber("Sample");
```

**Step 3**: Accept the absorber on each page to find all matching text fragments.
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= document.getPages().size(); i++) {
    document.getPages().get_Item(i).accept(textFragmentAbsorber);
}
```
This loop searches through each page, collecting matches for "Sample".

### Retrieve Text Fragment Collection
#### Overview
Once text fragments are absorbed, we retrieve them in a collection to process annotations.

**Step 1**: Import the required class.
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.TextFragmentCollection;
```

**Step 2**: Fetch the collection from the absorber.
```java
TextFragmentCollection textFragmentCollection = textFragmentAbsorber.getTextFragments();
```
This gives us access to all found instances of "Sample".

### Create Strike-Out Annotation
#### Overview
We'll add a strike-out annotation over each identified text fragment, highlighting or marking it visually.

**Step 1**: Import necessary classes.
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.StrikeOutAnnotation;
import com.aspose.pdf.Rectangle;
import com.aspose.pdf.Border;
import com.aspose.pdf.Color;
import com.aspose.pdf.Page;
```

**Step 2**: Loop through the text fragments and create annotations.
```java
for (int j = 1; j <= textFragmentCollection.size(); j++) {
    com.aspose.pdf.TextFragment textFragment = textFragmentCollection.get_Item(j);

    // Define the rectangle area for annotation based on text fragment's location.
    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle((float) textFragment.getPosition().getXIndent(),
                                   (float) textFragment.getPosition().getYIndent(),
                                   (float) textFragment.getPosition().getXIndent() + (float) textFragment.getRectangle().getWidth(),
                                   (float) textFragment.getPosition().getYIndent() + (float) textFragment.getRectangle().getHeight());

    // Create and configure the strike-out annotation.
    StrikeOutAnnotation strikeOut = new StrikeOutAnnotation(textFragment.getPage(), rect);
    strikeOut.setOpacity(0.80f);  // Set opacity to 80%
    strikeOut.setBorder(new Border(strikeOut));  // Initialize a border for the annotation
    strikeOut.setColor(Color.getRed());  // Set annotation color to red

    // Add the annotation to the page.
    textFragment.getPage().getAnnotations().add(strikeOut);
}
```
Each annotation is configured with opacity, border, and color settings before being added.

### Save Document with Annotations
#### Overview
After creating annotations, we save the annotated document.

**Step 1**: Import necessary classes if not already done.
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
```

**Step 2**: Define the output directory and save the document.
```java
String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
document.save(outputDir + "/StrikeOut.pdf");
```
This step finalizes your annotated PDF with all modifications intact.

## Practical Applications
Aspose.PDF for Java can be used in various scenarios, such as:
1. **Document Review Processes**: Automate the review process by programmatically marking required changes.
2. **Legal Document Handling**: Quickly annotate contracts or agreements with necessary redactions or edits.
3. **Educational Content Creation**: Enhance learning materials by striking out outdated information and annotating corrections.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance:
- Use efficient data structures when handling large collections of text fragments.
- Manage memory effectively, especially in resource-constrained environments.
- Regularly update to the latest Aspose.PDF version for enhanced features and fixes.

## Conclusion
