## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java

### Installation Information

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>

- **Temporary License:** For extensive testing, request a temporary license that unlocks full features for a limited time.
- **Purchase:** Consider purchasing if the library meets your project needs and requirements.

### Initialization and Setup


Once installed, initialize the `Document` class from Aspose.PDF to interact with PDF files. This setup allows seamless integration of document processing features into your Java applications.

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process of extracting embedded files using Aspose.PDF for Java.

### Extract Embedded Files Feature


This section demonstrates how to retrieve and save content embedded within a PDF file.

#### Step 1: Open the Document

```java
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "/input.pdf");
```
Here, we create a `Document` object pointing to our target PDF. This is your entry point for manipulating the document.

#### Step 2: Retrieve Embedded Files

```java
FileSpecification fileSpecification = pdfDocument.getEmbeddedFiles().get_Item(1);
```
This snippet fetches the first embedded file from the collection. Loop through all items if necessary.

#### Step 3: Access File Properties

For demonstration, let's print some properties of the extracted file:
```java
String fileName = fileSpecification.getName();
String description = fileSpecification.getDescription();
String mimeType = fileSpecification.getMIMEType();
```
Understanding these attributes helps in managing and categorizing files efficiently.

#### Step 4: Read and Save the File Content

Use streams to handle file data:
```java
try (java.io.InputStream input = fileSpecification.getContents();
     java.io.FileOutputStream output = new java.io.FileOutputStream(outputDir + "/output.txt\
