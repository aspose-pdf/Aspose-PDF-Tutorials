    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Document instance
        Document document = new Document();
        
        // Add tagged content creation code here
        
        System.out.println("PDF created successfully!");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you're set up, let's create a tagged PDF with images.

### Feature 1: Create and Configure Tagged Content in a PDF

#### Overview
Creating a tagged PDF ensures accessibility. This step covers setting the document's title and language for screen reader compatibility.

**Step 1: Create a New PDF Document**
```java
Document document = new Document();
```

**Step 2: Access the Tagged Content Layer**
Accessing the tagged content layer manages accessibility features:
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.tagged.ITaggedContent;

ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.getTaggedContent();
```

**Step 3: Set Title and Language**
Set these attributes for better screen reader support:
```java
taggedContent.setTitle("CreatePDFwithTaggedImage");
taggedContent.setLanguage("en-US");
```

### Feature 2: Add an Image to Tagged PDF Content

#### Overview
Adding images with proper tagging ensures they are accurately described by screen readers.

**Step 4: Create and Configure an Image Element**
Create a figure element for accessibility:
```java
import com.aspose.pdf.tagged.logicalstructure.elements.IllustrationElement;

IllustrationElement figure1 = taggedContent.createFigureElement();
taggedContent.getRootElement().appendChild(figure1);
figure1.setAlternativeText("Aspose Logo");
figure1.setTitle("Image 1");
figure1.setTag("Fig");

// Assume high-resolution image path
String imagePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/aspose-logo.jpg";
figure1.setImage(imagePath);
```

### Feature 3: Save Tagged PDF Document

#### Overview
Saving the document preserves your tagged content, ensuring accessibility.

**Step 6: Define File Path and Name**
Ensure you have a specified output directory:
```java
String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
document.save(outputDir + "PDFwithTaggedImage.pdf");
```

## Practical Applications
Creating tagged PDFs with images is useful in various scenarios:
1. **Educational Materials**: Enhancing textbooks for visually impaired students.
2. **Corporate Reports**: Making annual reports accessible to all stakeholders.
3. **E-commerce Product Catalogs**: Allowing visually impaired users to access detailed product descriptions.
