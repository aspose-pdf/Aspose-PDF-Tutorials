To begin using Aspose.PDF for Java, you'll need to add it to your project. Here’s how:

### Maven Setup
Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>

## Implementation Guide
Now, let's walk through each feature step-by-step:

### Setting Up a Tagged PDF Document
This section demonstrates how to set up a tagged PDF document with essential attributes like title and language.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Document
Create a new `Document` object and get its tagged content interface.

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
import com.aspose.pdf.tagged.ITaggedContent;

String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
String outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

Document document = new Document();
ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.getTaggedContent();
```

#### Step 2: Configure Title and Language
Set the title and language for your PDF, which helps with accessibility.

```java
taggedContent.setTitle("Tagged Pdf Document");
taggedContent.setLanguage("en-US");
document.save(outputDir + "/TaggedPdfSetup.pdf");
```

### Creating Header Elements in a Tagged PDF
Headers are crucial for structuring your document. This section shows how to add headers.

#### Step 1: Create and Configure the Header
Add a header element with specific text content.

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.tagged.logicalstructure.elements.bls.HeaderElement;

HeaderElement headerElement = taggedContent.createHeaderElement();
headerElement.setActualText("Heading 1");
document.save(outputDir + "/TaggedPdfWithHeader.pdf");
```

### Creating Paragraph Elements in a Tagged PDF
Adding paragraphs enhances the readability and structure of your document.

#### Step 1: Add Paragraphs to Your Document
Create multiple paragraph elements with different text contents.

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.tagged.logicalstructure.elements.bls.ParagraphElement;

ParagraphElement paragraphElement1 = taggedContent.createParagraphElement();
paragraphElement1.setActualText("test1");

ParagraphElement paragraphElement2 = taggedContent.createParagraphElement();
paragraphElement2.setActualText("test 2");
document.save(outputDir + "/TaggedPdfWithParagraphs.pdf");
```

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where tagged PDFs can be invaluable:
1. **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensuring your documents meet accessibility standards for visually impaired users.
2. **Improved Navigation:** Creating structured documents that enhance user navigation and readability.
3. **Integration with Assistive Technologies:** Seamlessly integrating with screen readers for better content delivery.
